## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling production rapidly (e.g., Arsenal-1 ramp, SRM to 6,000/year); supply chain resiliency (geopolitical risks, bottlenecks); labor shortages/high costs in manufacturing; EAC volatility; government delays/shutdowns affecting awards; integration of acquisitions/partnerships; cash burn ($800-900M in 2025 for growth); tech reliability issues (breakdowns/safety).

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling manufacturing/supply chain (e.g., Arsenal-1, SRM); optimizing for cost/resiliency; managing integrations (acquisitions, partnerships); reducing production risks/delays; leading talent ramp for 4,000+ jobs; backlog execution.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Arsenal-1 (Ohio, 5-acre hyperscale factory for drones/weapons); SRM factory (McHenry MS, 450-acre, 6,000 motors/year); facilities in CA (Costa Mesa, Irvine), GA (Atlanta), RI (Quincy), Australia, UAE R&D.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: 90% commercial components for resiliency; vertical integration for control/speed; global chain with geopolitical risks; mass production (e.g., Arsenal-1 for thousands of systems); distribution to military sites worldwide; challenges in tolerances/safety for defense hardware.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Senior Operations Manager (Costa Mesa, CA); Director of Manufacturing Operations (Atlanta, GA); Chief of Staff to CEO (Costa Mesa, CA); VP Supply Chain (Costa Mesa); other ops (Supply Chain Manager, Production Supervisor). Signals building for scaling.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  No specific names; organizational realignment (Jan 2026) and acquisitions indicate building ops for growth.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Brian Schimpf.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Brian Schimpf: Stratechery interview (2025 on Lattice SDK/CCA); Sourcery podcast (Dec 2025 on $1B revenue); Bloomberg Tech (Oct 2025); Semafor (Dec 2025 on incumbents). Palmer Luckey: Joe Rogan #2394 (Oct 2025); CNBC (Nov 2025 on production); 60 Minutes (May 2025 on warfare future).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation/speed, mission-driven (national security), software-first, risk-taking (internal R&D), flat/disciplined, battlefield-focused. Culture: Hands-on, agile, Silicon Valley style in defense; values agility, velocity, heritage+innovation. Position as builder of scalable, resilient ops for high-stakes innovation.

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment: Anduril's rapid scaling (7,000 employees, $1B revenue, Arsenal-1) needs ops builders; no VP Ops below CEO offers role to build function. Your acquisitions/scaling experience matches growth via buys/partnerships; hardware/AI fits autonomous systems; logistics/CPG overlaps supply chain in defense manufacturing; BUILD focus resonates with innovation model.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Emphasize building scalable defense ops with hardware/AI—e.g., "I've scaled to 18 markets with AI optimizing teams, like Anduril's Arsenal-1 ramp." Highlight mission: "Your battlefield innovation echoes my transformations in high-stakes sectors." Reference Schimpf's podcasts (Dec 2025 on revenue) or Luckey's Joe Rogan (Oct 2025). Outreach to Schimpf via LinkedIn; resonates with speed/innovation values and scaling challenges.
