## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years ops, 3 acquisitions (built/sold), scaled to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware (custom vehicles w/ engineers), AI transformation (150-to-2 org), sectors food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, desire to BUILD ops—alignment is moderate (6-7/10). BWXT is mature/public with established ops, but growth in enrichment/SMR/digital offers building opportunities. Your hardware/logistics/AI fits manufacturing/supply chain scaling; less direct nuclear but transferable.

Key alignments:  
- **Hardware/supply chain**: Custom design/logistics aligns with nuclear components/enrichment.  
- **Building/scaling**: Facility expansions ($1.5B contracts) suit your acquisition/market growth.  
- **AI/efficiency**: Digital transformation (new CDO) matches your AI org reduction.  

Gaps: Nuclear regs/safety specialization; more maintenance than pure build in mature segments. Stronger for ops in growth areas (e.g., Oak Ridge).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of hardware-intensive ops/supply chains in complex environments, with AI-driven efficiencies and scaling track record. Reference Geveden's innovation focus and recent Oak Ridge/Digital Center (e.g., "As BWXT scales domestic enrichment and digital ops, my hardware/AI scaling can accelerate resilient manufacturing for $7.4B backlog"). Resonate: Emphasize national security/energy mission, positioning as ops leader for "innovation driven" growth.
