## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  CoreWeave is the leading AI hyperscaler, delivering purpose-built cloud infrastructure optimized for GPU-accelerated workloads (training, inference, AI factories). It provides Kubernetes-native GPU compute, high-performance storage/networking, managed services, and tools for observability/security/ML ops. The model emphasizes bare-metal performance, rapid provisioning (10x faster inference spin-up), resilience (96%+ cluster goodput), and energy efficiency via NVIDIA integrations (Blackwell, Rubin, etc.). Revenue from usage-based cloud services, dedicated clusters for hyperscalers/enterprises, and platform fees; focuses on total ownership cost savings through specialized AI infrastructure.

- **Current stage (public, revenue if known).**  
  Public (NASDAQ: CRWV, IPO 2025). Explosive growth phase with $3.52B annualized revenue (June 2025 estimate), transitioning to profitability amid AI demand; $22B+ backlog visibility.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  Public; recent: $450M equity offering (Dec 2025, including SoftBank secondary). Pre-IPO total ~$12B+ private funding (NVIDIA, Magnetar, Fidelity, Blackstone, etc.).

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  501–1,000+ employees (rapid growth from ~239 in 2023 via 327%+ increase); aggressive hiring for data center scaling, engineering, and ops amid GW-capacity buildout.

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters: Livingston, NJ (US); global data centers (US, Europe). Hybrid/remote for many roles; data center/ops often require on-site/travel.

## Recent News & Momentum (Last 6 months)

- **Major announcements (funding, partnerships, product launches).**  
  Jan 26, 2026: NVIDIA $2B investment + collaboration for AI factories (adopt NVIDIA CPU/storage, multiple generations).  
  Feb 5, 2026: CoreWeave ARENA launch (production-scale AI lab for workload testing).  
  Jan 5, 2026: NVIDIA Rubin Platform extension.  
  Dec 2025: $450M equity offering; OpenAI deal expansion to ~$22.4B.

- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  Reuters/Bloomberg (Jan 2026): NVIDIA deal for data center buildout.  
  Motley Fool/Yahoo (Feb 2026): Key proofs needed in 2026 (delivery, leverage).  
  Positive on execution, backlog conversion.

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  Past merger scrutiny (Core Scientific, resolved). Challenges: Proving delivery on backlog, operating leverage, competition from hyperscalers.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  >5GW AI data center capacity by 2030; global buildout (US/Europe); hiring for scaling/ops.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Delivering on massive backlog ($22B+); GPU/power supply constraints; data center buildout velocity/costs; margin/leverage improvement; competition from AWS/Azure/Google.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling multi-GW data center deployments; supply chain optimization (GPUs/infrastructure); execution on hyperscaler contracts; driving operating leverage amid growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Dozens of data centers (US/Europe, GW-scale); high-density GPU clusters with liquid cooling.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  Extreme: Heavy NVIDIA dependency; global sourcing for GPUs/power; custom rack integration; logistics for rapid data center provisioning.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes: Chief of Staff to COO; VP Strategic Programs (partners with COO on ops priorities); Chief of Staff Product & Engineering; many data center/ops roles (technicians, managers).

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  SVP Engineering hires (2024); open CoS/VP roles signal building senior ops/execution team.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Mike Intrator (founder-led, hands-on scaling).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  CEO year-end message (Dec 31, 2025: "We Said We Would. Then We Did." on post-IPO scale/innovation).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Inclusive/empowering/engaging; committed to full potential; high-velocity execution. Position as proven scaler in hardware/AI infrastructure.

## Fit Assessment

Outstanding alignment (9.5/10). Your 15 years scaling ops (18 markets, $25M P&L, acquisitions) mirrors CoreWeave's hyperscale data center ramp/GW buildout. Hardware experience directly transferable to GPU/rack integration. AI transformation expertise ideal for efficiency in compute ops. Logistics background aligns with supply chain/data center logistics. Build focus perfect for current execution phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Hardware/AI ops scaler delivering velocity/leverage in constrained environments (e.g., GPU/power bottlenecks). Resonate: Reference CEO's 2025 message on execution/delivery; position as accelerator for backlog conversion and GW scaling, aligning with "We Did" ethos. Outreach Mike Intrator, citing NVIDIA deal and ARENA launch.
