## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  NuScale Power Corporation (SMR) designs, develops, and commercializes small modular reactors (SMRs), specifically the NuScale Power Module (NPM), a light water reactor generating 77 megawatts of electricity (MWe) per module, scalable up to 924 MWe (12 modules). The technology emphasizes passive safety, reduced costs, and flexibility for applications including electricity generation, data centers, desalination, hydrogen production, and process heat. Core model: License SMR technology, supply modules, and provide services; revenue from design licensing, module sales, and partnerships for deployment/operation; focuses on carbon-free, reliable energy with vertical integration and strategic collaborations.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Public (NYSE: SMR, listed May 2022 via SPAC merger). Development/commercialization stage with NRC-approved designs; pre-revenue for major deployments, focusing on first commercial operations ~2029-2030. Revenue: Q3 2025 $2.86M (development services); FY2025 projected low due to R&D focus.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  No new equity rounds (public); total raised pre-IPO ~$198M. Recent: Strategic agreements like Partnership Milestones Agreement (PMA) with Fluor (Nov 6, 2025, potential $148.5M milestone payment). DOE cost-share awards >$578M historically, including $262.7M through 2024.

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  330 full-time employees (as of 2024, likely similar; down from 540 in 2023 after 28% reduction Jan 2024). Growth: Scaling for commercialization, with hires in engineering/project delivery; trajectory tied to deployments (e.g., 6GW US program).

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters: Tigard, Oregon (moved from Corvallis; offices in Portland, Houston). Remote policy: Flexible work/life balance; hybrid/flexible for many roles, on-site for engineering/operations (e.g., contractor roles require Houston presence).

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Execution risks on large projects (e.g., 6GW timing/FID late 2026); cost overruns/construction delays; supply chain for module components (nuclear-specific); regulatory/compliance in new markets; competition from renewables/gas; talent acquisition for scaling.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Managing module manufacturing/supply chain with partners (Doosan); overseeing deployments (US/Romania); optimizing costs/timelines; navigating regulatory/partner interfaces; scaling operations for commercial readiness.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  No direct data centers/plants yet; manage R&D facilities in Corvallis/Tigard; logistics for module fabrication (with Doosan); future oversight of power plants via partners.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Nuclear-specific components; reliant on partners (Doosan for 20 modules/year); global sourcing risks (tariffs, delays); distribution/logistics for module transport to sites; complexity in scaling for first-of-kind (FOAK) builds.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes: Contractor - Project Manager (Houston/remote, through 2026, ops scaling); Manager, PM Resource Group (remote); Energy Exploration Center Program Manager (business/ops); Contractor - Civil/Structural Engineer (engineering ops); Manufacturing Engineer 2 (Mechanical Handling, remote). No explicit COO/VP Ops/Chief of Staff.

  James D. Canafax (CLO, Oct 20, 2025); David Tonnel (CFO, Nov 16, 2025); Anthony Lewis (prior CFO? Sep 2025). Signals building for commercialization/execution.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO John Hopkins or COO Carl Fisher.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  John Hopkins: Earnings calls (e.g., Q3 Nov 6, 2025 on ENTRA1/TVA); Q2 Aug 7, 2025. José Reyes (CTO): Podcast Ep 350 Scott Bailey VP Supply Chain (on supply chain); YouTube "NuScale Co-Founder on new nuclear energy" (whole different way of building power plants); Oregon's NuScale approval podcast (Jul 2025 on SMR vision).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation, safety, affordability, reliability, carbon-free energy; mission to improve quality of life via nuclear power; commitment to people, excellence, transformative technology. Culture: Innovative thinkers/doers, professional development, flexible balance, global partnerships; position as builder thriving in high-stakes, innovative energy environments.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (8/10). Your 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, supports NuScale's commercialization ramp (e.g., 6GW program, Romania). Hardware experience with electrical engineers transfers to SMR module manufacturing/integration. AI transformation could optimize supply chain/operations efficiency. Sectors like logistics align with data center/AI applications. Build-not-maintain preference fits development stage, with no legacy ops.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of scalable hardware ops in emerging tech, accelerating SMR manufacturing/deployment amid partnerships (e.g., ENTRA1/TVA). Resonate: Reference Hopkins/Reyes' talks on innovative nuclear (earnings, podcasts); tie to mission of affordable/reliable energy, positioning as executor for supply chain velocity and cost control.
