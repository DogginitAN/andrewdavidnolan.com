  Positive on growth/deals (e.g., stock surges 50%+ post-Microsoft/Meta announcements, 200-300% YTD 2025); analysts project $14B revenue by 2028, 521% growth to $3.45B in 2026; coverage on ARR targets, capex, undervaluation; Q3 results beat estimates.

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  Stock volatility (20.25% decline Jan 2026, correction post-rally); capex spike to $5B in 2025; execution risks on data center buildouts; leverage/dilution from financing; competition from hyperscalers.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  Target 2.5GW contracted power by end-2026 (up from 1GW); 800MW–1GW connected by end-2026; expand UK/Israel/NJ; new facilities US/Europe H1 2026; secure large sites (hundreds MW each, some operational end-2026); ARR $7–$9B by end-2026; headcount growth for R&D/ops (from 1,371, focusing on AI/engineers).

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Data center capacity bottlenecks limiting growth; massive capex ($5B 2025) straining finances; execution risks on multi-site buildouts (e.g., Vineland NJ, new US/Europe facilities); GPU/hardware supply constraints; leverage/dilution from funding; competition from hyperscalers; power/land acquisition in constrained markets.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling data center buildouts/power contracts; optimizing supply chain for GPUs/hardware; executing hyperscaler contracts (Microsoft/Meta); driving operational efficiency/leverage; managing multi-site expansions (US/Europe).

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Data centers: First-party in Finland; colocated in Kansas City US, Paris France, Iceland; new build-to-suit in Vineland NJ; expansions in UK, Israel, NJ; targeting 2.5GW contracted (800MW–1GW connected by end-2026).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: GPU/hardware sourcing (NVIDIA dependency); power/land acquisition for data centers; global dependencies for buildouts (US/Europe/Middle East); risks in costs/timelines, especially for 2.5GW target; capex-intensive scaling.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes: Chief of Staff (high-impact role supporting leadership rhythms/headcount/GTM); Head of Partner Operations (leadership, scaling global partner ops); Warehouse Operations Manager; DC Operations Manager; Operations Specialist (sales/docs/contractor management); Deployment Operations Specialist (ensure systems value, resolve challenges, scale processes); Data Collection Operations Supervisor (facilities/vendors/projects, operational excellence); Senior Global Supply Manager (structural). Signals building ops for data center expansions/deployments.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Arne Grimme/Matthew Weigand (non-executive directors, Aug 2025); signals governance build for growth; recent ops hires not specified, but open roles indicate expansion in partner ops/supply chain.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Arkady Volozh or COO Ophir Nave (oversight of infrastructure/operations scaling).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Arkady Volozh: Accel podcast (journey to Nebius, AI infra); YouTube (building AI era infrastructure, DLD25 on power); limited recent, but earnings calls (e.g., Q3 Nov 2025 on growth/deals).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Innovative/ambitious/multicultural (global team/hubs); expertise-driven (deep technical talent); customer-centric (tailored service, visibility); mission to accelerate AI globally; position as builder thriving in high-growth AI infra environments, emphasizing expertise/impact.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (9/10). Your 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, directly supports Nebius' data center expansions (2.5GW by 2026). 3 acquisitions align with potential growth M&A. Hardware experience transfers to GPU clusters/infra. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) resonates with efficiency amid capex. Sectors like logistics/CPG match AI applications (e.g., Avride delivery robotics). Build-not-maintain preference fits explosive phase (ARR $7–$9B by 2026, new facilities).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of scalable hardware/AI ops in high-growth environments, accelerating data center/supply chain execution for ARR targets. Resonate: Reference Volozh's talks on AI infra challenges (Accel/YouTube); tie to customer-centric values/expertise, positioning as partner for hyperscaler deals (Microsoft/Meta) and global scaling, aligning with innovative/ambitious culture.
