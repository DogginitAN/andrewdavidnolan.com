## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  At Series E with rapid scaling, challenges include Nvidia GPU supply shortages (9–12 month leads), power constraints for gigawatt AI factories, high capital costs for infrastructure, dependency on Nvidia (70–95% AI chip market), and competition from AMD/Intel alternatives. Managing decoherence in advanced tech like topological encoding, global supply chain for hardware manufacturing, and balancing demand (higher than supply) while maintaining low prices.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling deployment of massive AI factories (e.g., gigawatt-scale), optimizing supply chain for GPUs/hardware, managing logistics for data center expansions, improving operational efficiency in power-constrained environments, and handling multi-year hyperscaler contracts. Value in building resilient ops for fault-tolerant, high-speed AI compute amid shortages.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manages colocation data centers (San Francisco, Allen TX), new AI factories (Kansas City 2009-built facility, 24MW–100MW), and global cloud infrastructure. Deploys liquid-cooled systems with Nvidia InfiniBand networking for supercomputers.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Relies on Nvidia for GPUs (priority access but shortages); manufactures servers/workstations; distributes hardware globally. Challenges: Scaling production for 10,000+ GPUs, energy-efficient designs, and lease-back deals (e.g., $1.5B with Nvidia). Dependency risks if Nvidia shifts priorities.

## Open Roles

  Leonard Speiser (COO, Jan 2026); Heather Planishek (CFO, Dec 2025); Stacey Finerman (VP Investor Relations, Oct 2025). Signals: Building executive ops for scaling AI factories and finance amid growth.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Primary: CEO Stephen Balaban (oversees strategy/ops). Secondary: New COO Leonard Speiser (leads day-to-day execution, infrastructure scaling).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  CEO Stephen Balaban: Bloomberg Technology interviews (Feb 24, 2025 on AI infra demand; Mar 31, 2025 on compute sustainability). VP Revenue Robert Brooks: Raise Summit 2025 talk on AI evolution, power constraints, and hyperscaler deals (e.g., 10-figure Microsoft contract). Potential: TBPN podcast episodes (tech talks with AI leaders, though not confirmed for Lambda).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Obsess over customer (start with their success); brilliance/teamwork (smart, unstoppable collaborators); writing/communication (document ideas clearly); care deeply (pride in work, extra mile); hacker culture (passionate, curious, open-source focus; "Do-ocracy" and "Be Excellent to Each Other"); kindness/respect (no yelling, collaboration); low ego (outcome-focused, own mistakes); move fast (quick decisions); no politics/crypto. Culture: Hire for fit over pedigree; value expertise, handling chaos, cultural alignment. Position as: Builder who thrives in fast-paced, hacker-driven environments, focusing on customer-obsessed scaling and AI innovation.

## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold companies), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L responsibility, hardware experience (designing custom vehicles with electrical engineers), AI transformation (reducing a 150-person org to 2-person AI-powered operation), and sectors in food service, logistics, CPG, and last-mile delivery—your alignment with Lambda is strong. Lambda is in hyper-growth mode, building gigawatt-scale AI infrastructure amid supply shortages and power constraints, which mirrors your experience in scaling complex, hardware-intensive operations and leveraging AI for efficiency.

Key alignments:  
- **Scaling ops in hardware/AI**: Your hardware design and AI org transformation directly fit Lambda's need to manufacture/deploy GPU clusters and optimize AI workloads.  
- **Building vs. maintaining**: Lambda emphasizes "building the #1 AI compute platform" and gigawatt factories—perfect for your desire to build ops from scratch in a chaotic, high-stakes environment.  
- **Logistics/supply chain**: Experience in last-mile delivery and multi-market scaling aligns with managing Nvidia-dependent supply chains, data center logistics, and global expansions.  
- **Sectors overlap**: Logistics/CPG insights could inform Lambda's enterprise customer ops (e.g., manufacturing/pharma).  

Potential gaps: Less direct supercomputer/AI cloud exp, but your AI transformation and hardware work bridge this. Overall fit: 8/10—high potential for impact in ops scaling.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as a builder of resilient, AI-optimized operations in hardware-logistics-heavy environments, with proven scaling (18 markets, $25M P&L) and efficiency gains (150-to-2 AI shift). Reference their hacker culture and "move fast" value by highlighting your chaos-handling and quick-decision expertise from acquisitions. Resonate with leadership (e.g., Balaban): Emphasize shared vision for AI's "significant technological shift" (from his interviews), offering to accelerate gigawatt factory builds and hyperscaler deals like Microsoft. Tailor outreach: "As Lambda deploys Blackwell GPUs in Kansas City, my hardware/AI scaling exp can build ops to meet surging demand without bottlenecks."
