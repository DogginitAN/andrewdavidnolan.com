## Fit Assessment

Your profile aligns well with Vertiv's AI/data center growth needs. 15 years ops experience, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, and hardware design with engineers match manufacturing/supply chain complexities. AI transformation (150 to 2-person ops) adds value for efficiency in cooling/power systems. Sectors like logistics/CPG parallel global distribution. Focus on building ops fits their expansion phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize scaling hardware ops for AI infrastructure (e.g., "Designed vehicles with engineers, AI-optimized ops—ready to tackle Vertiv's supply chain/tariff challenges"). Highlight growth execution: "Scaled 18 markets/$25M P&L; eager to build efficiency in manufacturing expansions." Reference Albertazzi's 2026 goals video on AI momentum. Resonate with innovation/sustainability values for digital infrastructure impact.
