## Operational Landscape

Challenges: NRC/CNSC regulatory delays, HALEU fuel supply constraints (scarcity, geopolitics), high development costs/overruns, nuclear talent shortages, scaling novel microreactor manufacturing/transport, cash management post-raises.

Where senior ops adds value: Scaling supply chain/manufacturing for microreactors and fuel (HALEU transport/fabrication), managing deployments (UIUC, federal, international), optimizing logistics for remote/space sites, ensuring compliance/efficiency, vertical integration coordination.

Infrastructure: Oak Brook IL facility (23,537 sq ft), potential UIUC site, Chalk River Ontario (Canadian licensing), INL testing. HALEU transport baskets (patented, via AFT subsidiary).

Supply chain complexity: Very high — vertical integration (fuel fab/transport), scarce HALEU reliance (Centrus/LIS), global sourcing (Argentina uranium), radiological handling/safety, novel microreactor assembly/distribution to remote/federal/space sites.

## Open Roles

- No COO, VP Ops, or Chief of Staff listed
- Project Managers (3 roles: general, engineering, development — $120K-$160K, Midwest)
- Licensing Engineers (2 roles — $130K-$161K)
- Various nuclear/mech/elec/civil engineering ($90K-$161K)
- Signals: Building ops function for deployments/licensing

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment (8/10). Hardware experience transfers to microreactor manufacturing/integration. AI transformation could optimize fuel supply chains. Logistics/last-mile aligns with HALEU transport and remote deployments. Build-not-maintain preference fits pre-revenue stage with no legacy ops. NYC HQ is a plus. Only 36 employees — very early, ground-floor ops build.

No COO, no Chief of Staff, no CFO identified — significant leadership gaps for a company with $600M+ raised. This is where ops infrastructure needs to be built from scratch.

**Strongest angle:** Hardware/AI-driven scaling + logistics expertise to accelerate microreactor deployments and supply chain resilience. Reference Walker's/Yu's interviews on nuclear renaissance. You hold the stock — skin in the game narrative. NYC HQ accessible. Target Walker or Yu directly.
