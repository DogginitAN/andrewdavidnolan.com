## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Power availability bottlenecks (AI demand doubling energy use by 2026); supply chain delays for GPUs/equipment; scaling modular builds amid lead times; integrating variable energy (stranded gas, renewables); grid reliability in remote sites; high operational costs (potentially doubling by 2027); talent shortages for interdisciplinary roles.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing in-house manufacturing/supply chain to bypass bottlenecks; scaling energy sourcing/integration for new sites; managing rapid deployments (e.g., 12-month timelines); ensuring flexibility in power (e.g., microgrids with batteries/solar); driving efficiency in edge/AI compute operations.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Large-scale data centers (e.g., Abilene, TX 1.2GW; Wyoming 1.8GW; Iceland, Norway); modular units for edge deployments; microgrids with solar/second-life batteries (e.g., Redwood partnership, June 26, 2025); energy sources (flared gas, renewables, nuclear). Logistics: In-house manufacturing of electrical/switchgear; global deployments including space.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Vertical integration for electrical equipment to avoid delays (in-house via Crusoe Industries); GPU sourcing (thousands of AMD MI300X, NVIDIA Blackwell); deploying in remote/energy-rich areas; handling variable power; global expansions (e.g., Middle East, space); risks in timelines/costs amid AI demand.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Insufficient content on careers page; no specific openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership listed. General openings in AI cloud, data centers, manufacturing, engineering, and business development.

  Nader Pakfar (General Counsel, Real Estate, January 21, 2026). Atero acquisition (August 21, 2025) adds ops expertise in GPU optimization. Signals building via expansions and vertical integration.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Chase Lochmiller or COO Cully Cavness, given founder-led structure and ops focus on energy/AI integration.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Chase Lochmiller: CNBC 'Squawk on the Street' (October 24, 2025: compute constraints); All-In Podcast (January 25, 2026: AI buildout); Bloomberg Tech Disruptors (March 21, 2025: energy-first approach); MCJ Summit (October 29, 2025: AI/energy); Path to Zero Podcast (flared gas to power); TITV (October 24, 2025: space data center). Cully Cavness: Texas Energy and Power (replay November 26, 2025: wasted energy for AI); Oil and Gas Startups Podcast (August 30, 2021: culture/building).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Align computing with climate (sustainable energy); innovation at AI/energy intersection; idea meritocracy; DEI in recruiting; incremental innovation; talent magnet with interdisciplinary, ambitious teams. Culture: Lead from front; preparation/curiosity/speed; mission-driven to unlock abundant energy/intelligence. Position as builder thriving in energy-constrained, high-velocity environments.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (9/10). Your 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets with $25M P&L, aligns with Crusoe's rapid data center expansions (e.g., Abilene in 12 months, Wyoming 1.8GW). Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical) transfers to modular builds and energy integration. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) resonates with optimizing compute amid power constraints. Logistics/CPG/last-mile sectors match energy sourcing and supply chain challenges. Build-not-maintain preference fits growth phase post-AI pivot.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of scalable, AI-optimized ops in resource-constrained environments, addressing energy/supply chain bottlenecks. Resonate: Reference Lochmiller's interviews on power constraints (e.g., CNBC, All-In); tie to mission of abundant energy/intelligence, positioning as accelerator for AI factories via efficiency gains.
