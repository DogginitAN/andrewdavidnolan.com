## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Supply chain vulnerabilities (geopolitical risks, complex processes), increased production costs/labor shortages, EAC volatility (unfavorable changes from new technologies), delays in government contracts/awards due to shutdowns, integration of acquisitions (e.g., Edge Autonomy), cash burn from growth.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing supply chain and manufacturing processes for resiliency/cost reduction, managing acquisition integrations, scaling production for backlog execution, leading EAC improvements, overseeing multi-domain operations (space/defense tech), talent acquisition for growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  17+ facilities in US and Europe, including Jacksonville HQ, manufacturing sites (e.g., Michigan for fuel cells, Potomac 60,000 sq ft facility opened August 2023 for satellite production/testing). Logistics: Global supply chain for space hardware, distribution to government/commercial sites.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Vertically integrated manufacturing (controls from raw materials to assembly), global supply chain with geopolitical risks, complex processes for high-reliability space hardware, distribution to international customers/missions, challenges in scaling for new technologies.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Chief Engineer, Space Missions (Littleton, CO); System Administrator (Chantilly, VA); Senior Manufacturing Engineer (Longmont, CO); Director of Business Development, FED/CIV (remote); Maintenance Manager (Midland, TX); Director, IT & Infrastructure (Midland, TX); Manufacturing Engineer (various levels); Production Supervisor. No explicit Chief of Staff or COO/VP Ops roles, but leadership in business development and operations signals focus on growth.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  No specific recent ops hires named, but organizational realignment (January 2026) into Space (Michael Gold) and Defense Tech (Steve Adlich) segments signals building leadership for multi-domain operations. Acquisition of Edge Autonomy (June 2025) added defense tech talent.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Peter Cannito (founder-led oversight of strategy/operations).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Peter Cannito: CNBC interview (January 27, 2026, on Edge Autonomy acquisition/full interview on CNBC.com); Motley Fool podcast (January 18, 2026); YouTube interview (2025 on Edge Autonomy); Fox Business (January 2025 on SpaceMD venture); Spacepower Podcast (Episode 33 with Dean Bellamy, EVP National Security Space).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation/excellence, breaking boundaries, heritage + innovation, client-first, family-oriented, performance-driven, curiosity, diversity of thought/experience. Culture: Global community of innovators/visionaries, collaborative, promotes from within, loves the work, fast-paced with astronomical impact. Position as builder of scalable ops aligning with growth/mission-critical execution.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI setup, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, desire to BUILD ops) aligns strongly with Redwire's growth phase post-Edge Autonomy acquisition, focusing on multi-domain scaling and integration. No VP Ops below CEO creates opportunity to build the function amid challenges like supply chain resiliency and production ramps. Your hardware/AI expertise fits space/defense manufacturing; multi-market scaling matches global expansion (US/Europe); logistics overlaps supply chain management.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with BUILDING resilient ops in hardware-innovative environments—e.g., "I've scaled delivery across 18 markets with AI optimizations, mirroring Redwire's multi-domain growth post-Edge Autonomy." Highlight mission alignment: "Your heritage + innovation ethos resonates with my transformations for efficiency in high-stakes sectors." Reference Cannito's interviews (e.g., January 2026 CNBC on defense tech expansion). Outreach to Cannito via LinkedIn, positioning as partner for backlog execution/SHIELD opportunities. Resonates with curiosity/impact culture and geopolitical/supply challenges.
