# Celsius Holdings Research

## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Celsius Holdings, Inc. (CELH) is a global beverage company that develops, markets, and distributes functional energy drinks under the CELSIUS brand. The drinks are positioned as premium, better-for-you options with zero sugar, clinically proven ingredients for metabolism boost, and lifestyle appeal. The core business model relies on brand building through marketing, innovation, and a capital-light distribution partnership with PepsiCo (which handles U.S. and international distribution), allowing Celsius to focus on product development and consumer engagement while leveraging PepsiCo's network for scale.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Public company (NASDAQ: CELH) since 2007 (formerly a small cap, explosive growth post-2019). Late-stage growth phase with trailing revenue approximately $2.1 billion as of late 2025, driven by rapid market share gains in the energy drink category.

  Public company; no recent private funding. In August 2025, PepsiCo increased its stake via a $585 million deal, strengthening the strategic partnership.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Limited owned infrastructure (capital-light model); relies on co-packers for manufacturing and PepsiCo for distribution/logistics. Manages third-party relationships for production and warehousing.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  Moderate-high: Outsourced manufacturing (co-packers), global sourcing for ingredients/cans, heavy reliance on PepsiCo for U.S./international distribution. Complexity increasing with international growth and portfolio expansion.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling delivery to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, AI transformation of 150-person org to 2-person, CPG/logistics/last-mile sectors, focus on BUILDING ops) aligns very well with Celsius' current phase. The company is scaling rapidly in CPG distribution (PepsiCo leverage, international), facing supply chain/ops optimization needs—directly matching your logistics/CPG scaling and AI efficiency expertise. Acquisition experience fits Alani Nu integration; desire to build (vs. maintain) suits their growth trajectory.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize CPG scaling and distribution optimization (e.g., "Scaled last-mile delivery ops to 18 markets/$25M P&L in consumer goods, ready to streamline Celsius' PepsiCo transition and international supply chain"). Highlight AI-driven efficiency: "Transformed 150-person ops to lean AI-powered model, aligning with Celsius' high-velocity execution." Reference Fieldly's interviews on growth sustainability and partnerships to show research. Resonate by positioning as a builder accelerating their "live fit" disruption in energy drinks.
