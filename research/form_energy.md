- **Any controversies or challenges**  
  No major controversies. Challenges: Skepticism on commercializing long-duration storage in a short-duration dominant market; historical LDES failures (e.g., Aquion). Supply chain diversification needed amid global disruptions. Clean energy sector cancellations hit records in Q4 2025 due to policy shifts, but Form avoided direct impact.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount)**  
  Form Factory 1 expansion (Weirton, WV) to 1M sq ft by 2028, 750+ employees. International scaling post-US (e.g., Ireland contracts). Headcount growth to support 500 MW annual production. New markets: Data centers, grid infrastructure; imminently finalizing utility deals for large load tariffs.

## Operational Landscape
- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling high-volume manufacturing amid overcapacity in short-duration batteries; supply chain vulnerabilities (e.g., iron processing, global trade disruptions like tariffs). Commercializing 100-hour tech in a market favoring 4-hour lithium-ion; grid integration risks from weather/reliability; talent gaps for clean energy transition. Energy grid constraints (e.g., power reliability for factories).

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing supply chain and manufacturing ramp-up at Form Factory 1; building scalable ops for deployments (e.g., pilot to GWh-scale); AI-driven efficiency in production; managing logistics for battery shipments and installations.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Form Factory 1 (Weirton, WV: 1M sq ft manufacturing); R&D in Somerville, MA; engineering in Berkeley, CA. Logistics: Shipping battery systems (e.g., to Minnesota pilot in 2025). Grid-connected test sites in Bay Area (28,000+ cells tested).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Iron-air tech requires specialized air cathodes (acquired via NantEnergy in 2020); global supply diversification to avoid tariffs/FEoC rules. Manufacturing: From prototypes to 500 MW capacity; distribution involves utility-scale deployments with enclosures/modules. Complexity in scaling green iron production and ensuring safety (UL-certified).

## Open Roles
- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  50+ open roles as of early 2026, including operations-focused (e.g., supply chain, manufacturing, programs). No explicit COO/VP Ops or Chief of Staff openings listed, but hiring signals building ops functions (e.g., VP Programs Katherine Spriggs). Roles emphasize scaling iron-air deployments.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function)**  
  No specific recent ops hires reported, but leadership additions in 2025 (e.g., three new team members for growth). Overall hiring surge (dozens of roles) indicates ops build-out for factory expansion and commercial pilots.

## Outreach Intel
- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists)**  
  CEO Mateo Jaramillo (leads strategic hires) or COO Ted Wiley (oversees operations scaling).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - Mateo Jaramillo: Energy Unplugged Podcast (Ep. 204, July 2024); First Time Founders Podcast (January 2025); Earthshot Prize interview with Ashley Grosh (October 2025).  
  - General: Metro News Talkline (2023, but relevant for culture); YouTube overviews (e.g., Form Energy: An Overview, January 2025). Reference scaling challenges and meaningful impact in clean energy.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Core values: Humanity (inclusive, supportive), Excellence (rigorous innovation), Creativity (bold problem-solving). Culture: Mission-driven, focused on meaningful work in grid transformation; emphasis on impact (e.g., Rust Belt jobs, CO2 reductions). Position as builder of scalable ops aligning with growth from pilots to global scale.

## Fit Assessment
The candidate's profile aligns strongly with Form Energy's needs at this commercialization stage. With 15 years in operations, including scaling delivery to 18 markets and managing a $25M P&L, you match Form's trajectory from pilots (e.g., 2026 deployments) to multi-GWh contracts. Hardware experience (custom vehicles with electrical engineers) directly translates to battery manufacturing and grid integration. AI transformation (replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI ops) could optimize Form's production and supply chain efficiencies amid scaling challenges. Sectors like logistics, CPG, and last-mile delivery overlap with energy storage's distribution complexities.

Your desire to BUILD (not maintain) ops fits perfectly—Form is ramping manufacturing (Form Factory 1 expansion) and needs senior ops to architect functions for growth, not sustain status quo. Potential gaps: Limited direct energy sector experience, but hardware/AI scaling bridges this.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with your track record in building scalable hardware ops from scratch, emphasizing AI-driven efficiencies (e.g., "Scaled logistics ops with AI, reducing headcount 99%—ready to optimize Form's iron-air production for 500 MW capacity"). Reference Jaramillo's interviews on innovation/impact (e.g., Earthshot talk) to tie your acquisitions/exits to Form's mission: "Excited to build ops that accelerate multi-day storage deployments, creating Rust Belt jobs and CO2 reductions." Position as a partner in humanity/excellence values, focusing on collaborative scaling. Outreach to Jaramillo/Wiley via LinkedIn, citing recent news (e.g., Factory expansion) for relevance.
