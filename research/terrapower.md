**TerraPower** (terrapower.com) is a private, late-stage advanced nuclear company developing the **Natrium** sodium-cooled fast reactor (345 MWe base + molten salt storage for peaking to 500 MWe). It also works on medical isotopes.

### Company Profile
- **Core business model**: Design, license, and deploy Natrium plants through utility partnerships, PPAs, and project development. They pursue first-of-a-kind demo (Kemmerer, WY) via DOE ARDP cost-share, followed by commercial fleet sales/licensing to data centers/utilities.
- **Current stage**: Private, late-stage (non-LWR demo under construction; pre-commercial revenue). First plant targets ~2030-2031 operation.
- **Recent funding**: $650M (June 2025) from Bill Gates + NVIDIA (NVentures) + others. Total raised ~$1.5-1.6B + ~$2B DOE awards.
- **Employee count & growth**: ~988-1,076 (PitchBook/LinkedIn estimates, 2025-early 2026). Rapid growth (hundreds added in recent years) driven by Natrium construction and commercialization.
- **HQ & remote policy**: Bellevue, WA (15800 Northup Way). Primary project site: Kemmerer, WY. Roles are mostly hybrid/on-site (nuclear/hardware-intensive); some corporate flexible; no formal "fully remote" policy published.
- **Key customers/partners**: PacifiCorp (Wyoming demo), Meta (up to 8 plants, Jan 9 2026), DOE (ARDP), Bechtel (EPC), GE Hitachi, HD Hyundai (supply chain), KBR (global commercialization alliance), Sabey Data Centers (MoU), Evergy/Kansas (exploration).

### Leadership & Org Structure
- **CEO**: Chris Levesque (President & CEO since 2018; long-tenured operator).
- **COO**: Eric Williams — promoted to first EVP & Chief Operating Officer (May 21, 2025; previously senior ops role).
- **Chief of Staff**: Not publicly listed.
- **CFO**: Steven Hellman (new EVP & CFO, appointed mid-2025; Marcia Burkey retired after 12 years).
- **Other C-suite/key**: John Gilleland (CTO), George Wilson (SVP Regulatory Affairs).
- **Recent exec hires/departures (last 12 months)**: Eric Williams → COO (May 2025); Steven Hellman → CFO (2025); Marcia Burkey retired.
- **Board/notable investors**: Chairman Bill Gates; Vice Chairman Nathan Myhrvold; investors include Gates, NVIDIA, SK, HD Hyundai, etc.

### Recent News & Momentum (Last 6 months)
- **Major announcements**: Jan 9, 2026 — Landmark Meta agreement for up to 8 Natrium plants (first two ~2032). Ongoing NRC progress (draft/final safety evaluation complete late 2025; nuclear construction permit expected early 2026). Construction milestones at Kemmerer (non-nuclear underway; nuclear island pending).
- **Press highlights**: Meta deal widely covered; NRC EIS & safety review praise; "leading US advanced nuclear project."
- **Controversies/challenges**: Typical first-of-a-kind risks (supply chain, HALEU availability, schedule/cost); no major scandals.
- **Expansion plans**: Multiple follow-on Natrium sites (data centers, utilities in KS/UT); supply chain globalization (HD Hyundai, KBR); headcount growth continuing for manufacturing/operations ramp.

### Operational Landscape
- **Likely challenges**: Scaling first-of-a-kind sodium reactor manufacturing/supply chain, HALEU/TRISO fuel, regulatory commissioning, site-specific EPC coordination, workforce training (SROs/operators), cost/schedule discipline.
- **Senior ops value-add**: Highest in manufacturing ramp, supply chain vertical integration, field construction/ops commissioning, training/program procedures, P&L control during demo-to-fleet transition.
- **Physical/logistics infrastructure**: Bellevue HQ + Everett/engineering facilities + Kemmerer construction site (major EPC). Manages complex component logistics (reactor vessels, sodium systems).
- **Supply chain/manufacturing complexity**: Very high — sodium components, specialized alloys, long-lead nuclear forgings; heavy reliance on qualified vendors + vertical integration push.

### Open Roles
- **Current openings**: Multiple ops-relevant: Operations Training Instructor / Senior Reactor Operator (SRO) Candidate (Kemmerer), Operations & Maintenance Procedure Supervisor, Facilities/Construction roles, Project Managers. No open COO/VP Ops/Chief of Staff (COO role recently filled).
- **Recent ops hires**: Signals strong build-out — new COO, heavy hiring for Natrium operations training/SRO pipeline.

### Outreach Intel
- **Decision-maker**: Likely CEO Chris Levesque or new COO Eric Williams (hands-on scaling focus).
- **Interviews/podcasts to reference**: Chris Levesque interviews (e.g., on Natrium timeline, Meta deal, 2030 operation); Eric Williams quotes on operations ramp.
- **Culture/values**: Mission-driven (climate + energy security), engineering-first, "build fast but safely," emphasis on execution and learning from demo.

### Fit Assessment
Excellent alignment. Your hardware scaling + electrical engineering experience maps directly to Natrium component/assembly challenges. AI-driven ops transformation is highly relevant for manufacturing yield, construction sequencing, and predictive maintenance in a first-of-kind nuclear build. Logistics/CPG scaling + P&L ownership matches the complex supply chain and multi-site deployment needs. Acquisitions signal M&A/integration readiness for vendor/partnership consolidation. Your explicit desire to **BUILD** (vs. maintain) is perfect — TerraPower is in the intense "build the first one right" phase, not steady-state ops.

**Strongest outreach angle**: Lead with hardware + AI ops transformation in complex, regulated environments ("I've designed custom vehicles with EEs and AI-reduced a 150-person org to 2 — ready to scale Natrium manufacturing, commissioning, and supply chain"). Tie to mission urgency ("Scaled 18-market delivery/$25M P&L; eager to build ops that deliver the first US advanced reactor fleet on time"). Reference the Meta deal and recent COO promotion to show you've done homework. This will resonate strongly with Levesque/Williams.
