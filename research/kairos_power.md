## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling in-house manufacturing (components, salt, fuel), supply chain for HALEU/TRISO, regulatory compliance, cost/schedule certainty in construction, workforce training for nuclear operations.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing manufacturing/supply chain, commissioning complex plants (e.g., ETU/Hermes), improving efficiency/cost control, managing training/simulators.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Alameda HQ (corporate/R&D); Albuquerque Manufacturing Development Campus (Salt Facility, ETU); Oak Ridge Hermes site. Logistics for component transport/deployment.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Vertical integration for unique components; partnerships for fuel (BWXT), HALEU (DOE); molten salt production; compliance-heavy distribution to sites.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes: Senior Engineering Operations Engineer (commissioning/ops expertise). No Chief of Staff or COO/VP Ops listed, but ops roles signal building for scale.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  No specific recent hires; VPs in manufacturing/operations (e.g., Craig Gerardi) indicate focus on ops build for Hermes/deployments.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Mike Laufer, given small C-suite and hands-on role.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Mike Laufer: C.O.B. Tuesday Podcast (January 2026) on vision/strategy; YouTube "Introduction to Kairos Power" (older). Reference cost certainty, iterative development.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation, learning by building, mission-driven (clean energy/climate impact), diverse/inclusive, expertise-focused. Culture: Motivated, collaborative, real-world progress. Position as impact-oriented builder for complex challenges.

## Fit Assessment

Your 15 years in operations, with scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, and AI transformation (150 to 2-person ops), aligns strongly with Kairos's needs for building manufacturing/supply chain in nuclear hardware. Sectors like logistics/CPG parallel complex regulated ops; acquisition experience fits partnerships. Focus on building (not maintaining) matches their iterative, growth-stage phase.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Highlight hardware scaling/AI efficiency for nuclear innovation (e.g., "Designed vehicles with engineers, AI-optimized ops—ready to build Kairos's manufacturing/ETU for cost certainty"). Emphasize mission impact: "Scaled global ops; eager to drive clean energy deployments." Reference Laufer's podcast on strategy/iteration. Resonate with values of learning/building for climate solutions.
