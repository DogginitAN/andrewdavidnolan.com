## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware design with electrical engineers, AI transformation reducing 150-person org to 2-person, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, focus on BUILDING ops) aligns strongly with CHAOS's needs. The company is in hyper-growth (from stealth to $4.5B in 3 years), scaling manufacturing/deployments for counter-drone tech—leveraging your hardware/AI/logistics expertise. Acquisition experience fits Ziva integration; build focus matches ramp-up phase.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize hardware/AI scaling for defense impact (e.g., "Designed custom vehicles with engineers and AI-optimized ops, ready to build CHAOS's manufacturing/supply chain for faster threat detection"). Highlight mission alignment: "Scaled global logistics/$25M P&L; eager to drive domain dominance protecting lives." Reference Tenet's Reuters on ramp-up and Hurd's podcast on autonomy to show research. Resonate by positioning as a partner accelerating urgent innovation.
