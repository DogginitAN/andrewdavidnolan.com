  2025 highlights (announced in funding): Large-scale deployment (60x prior), two pilot shipments, production go-live, new HQ/factory.

- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  Fortune (Jan 15, 2026: Exclusive on Series C, CEO on platform shift).  
  PR Newswire/SiliconAngle/The Robot Report (Jan 15-19, 2026: Funding details, progress quotes).

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  None identified. Challenges: Meeting explosive deployment demand, talent acquisition in competitive robotics space.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  Scale customer deployments globally; leverage new Brisbane factory (7x prior space); aggressive hiring (20+ roles, seniors in EE, TPM, safety).

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Rapid scaling of hardware manufacturing (bots/cells); nationwide/global site deployments; supply chain for custom components; ensuring reliability in live production; talent ramp for velocity.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling manufacturing/production in new factory; managing deployment logistics/installations; optimizing supply chain/resilience; integrating customer sites efficiently.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  100,000 sq ft Brisbane campus (R&D, manufacturing); customer warehouse installations (grids, bots); deployment teams for on-site commissioning.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Custom robotics (patented Helix bots, structural cells); sourcing for heavy-lift components/sensors; distribution/deployment to customer sites; scaling production amid demand surge.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  20+ roles, including: Deployment Engineer, Facilities Technician, Supply Chain Analyst, Senior Global Supply Manager (structural), Senior Technical Program Manager, Director Electrical Engineering, Safety Systems Engineering Architect. No explicit Chief of Staff; signals building ops/deployment/scaling functions.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  VP Scaling (Nigel Marcussen), CFO (Gabi Gantus), CDO (Ingrid Cotoros) – all 2024-2025; focus on execution velocity and production ramp.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Chris Walti (founder-led, hands-on in scaling/operations).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Chris Walti: Fortune exclusive (Jan 2026 funding, quotes on "platform shift" vs incremental robots); earlier interviews on talent attraction (Oct 2024), Tesla lessons.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  High-velocity execution, intensity, pragmatism, feedback-driven; ex-Tesla/Rivian rigor in manufacturing/scaling. Position as builder thriving in fast-ramp hardware environments.

## Fit Assessment

Outstanding alignment (9.5/10). Your 15 years scaling operations (18 markets, $25M P&L, 3 acquisitions) mirrors Mytra's post-Series C deployment ramp and ex-Tesla velocity needs. Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical engineers) directly transferable to bot/grid manufacturing. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) aligns with their AI-optimized, efficient platform. Logistics/CPG/food/last-mile sectors match customers (food/industrial distributors). Build-not-maintain focus perfect for current scaling phase (new factory, large deployments).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven hardware/AI ops builder from Tesla-like ramps, accelerating manufacturing/deployment scaling amid demand surge. Resonate: Reference Walti's quotes on "fundamental platform shift" and velocity (Fortune/PR); position as key to executing large-site rollouts and supply chain resilience, aligning with ex-Tesla intensity/pragmatism. Outreach Chris Walti directly via LinkedIn, citing Series C momentum and 2025 progress.
