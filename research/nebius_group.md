## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Nebius Group N.V. (NBIS) builds vertically integrated AI infrastructure, providing a full-stack AI cloud platform with large-scale GPU clusters (primarily NVIDIA, including Blackwell and upcoming Vera Rubin NVL72) optimized for intensive AI/ML workloads. The platform offers scale, flexibility, and hyperscaler reliability for customers ranging from startups to enterprises and national programs. Additional businesses include Avride (autonomous vehicles/robots), Toloka (AI data labeling), TripleTen (edtech), and ClickHouse (open-source database). Core model: Revenue from cloud usage fees, dedicated capacity contracts with hyperscalers, and value-added services; emphasizes efficiency through in-house optimization.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Public company (NASDAQ: NBIS). Explosive growth phase post-restructuring from Yandex NV (2024 spin-off of Russian assets). Revenue: Q2 2025 $105.1M (625% YoY growth); Q3 2025 results reported November 11, 2025; strong multi-quarter trajectory with sold-out capacity.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  September 2025: Closed ~$4.2B gross proceeds ($1B+ public offering of Class A shares + $2.75B convertible senior notes, upsized). Multi-year hyperscaler deals provide additional non-dilutive capital (e.g., Microsoft multi-billion, Meta ~$3B over 5 years).

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  1,371 employees as of December 31, 2024 (post-spin-off decline from prior Yandex scale, but rapid rebuilding). Growth: Hundreds of engineers focused on infrastructure/AI R&D; 220+ open roles indicate aggressive scaling for data center expansions and global operations.

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters: Amsterdam, Netherlands. Global hubs in Europe, North America, Middle East, Israel. Remote/hybrid likely for many roles; data center/ops positions often location-specific (e.g., Amsterdam, Paris, US sites).

- **Key customers or partners.**  
  Hyperscalers: Microsoft (multi-billion dedicated capacity, starting Vineland NJ), Meta (~$3B over 5 years). Others: National programs (Israel Innovation Authority AI supercomputer, recent win), NVIDIA (deep integration for Blackwell/Rubin), startups/research via grants/awards. Sectors: Healthcare, robotics, finance, entertainment.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Executing rapid data center buildouts (multiple GW-scale sites); securing power contracts amid shortages; GPU supply chain bottlenecks; construction timelines/costs; integrating new regions while maintaining reliability/margins.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling global data center deployments/operations; optimizing supply chain for GPUs/power; standardizing processes for hyperscaler contracts; driving efficiency in multi-site logistics and capacity management.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Multiple data centers: Finland (75MW), New Jersey (up to 300MW), Israel (80MW), UK, Iceland, US East Coast phases. GPU clusters, power infrastructure.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Heavy reliance on NVIDIA GPUs (Blackwell/Rubin); power sourcing; global construction partners; logistical challenges for remote/expandable sites; execution risks in timelines and costs.

## Open Roles

  Arkady Volozh: Accel podcast (journey to Nebius, AI infra build); YouTube interviews (e.g., building AI era infrastructure, DLD25 on power of infrastructure); multiple 2025 appearances on vision/execution.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Innovative, ambitious, multicultural (global team); expertise-driven (hundreds of engineers); mission to accelerate AI globally. Position as proven builder in hardware/AI scaling, thriving in high-growth infrastructure environments.

## Fit Assessment

Excellent alignment (9/10). Your 15 years scaling operations (18 markets, $25M P&L) directly maps to Nebius' explosive post-restructuring growth and multi-GW data center expansions. Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical engineers) transfers to GPU cluster builds/power integration. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) resonates with optimizing efficiency amid capacity constraints. Logistics/last-mile background aligns with global site logistics/power sourcing. Build-not-maintain focus ideal for current phase (no legacy maintenance, pure scaling).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as operator who builds resilient, AI-optimized supply chains and multi-site operations to accelerate data center deployments amid GPU/power bottlenecks. Resonate: Reference Volozh's interviews on infrastructure challenges/journey (e.g., Accel podcast); emphasize hardware/logistics expertise enabling hyperscaler-scale execution, aligning with mission to power global AI innovation. Target Volozh/Nave via LinkedIn, citing recent Meta/Microsoft deals and expansions.
