## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience (custom vehicles with engineers), AI transformation (150-to-2 person org), sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile, and desire to build ops—alignment with X-Energy is strong (8/10). X-Energy is in rapid expansion, building SMR infrastructure amid supply chain complexities, mirroring your scaling and hardware expertise. Your AI efficiency could optimize nuclear ops, and logistics background fits global supply chains.

Key alignments:  
- **Scaling/building ops**: Matches X-Energy's need to deploy 144 reactors across markets.  
- **Hardware/supply chain**: Custom hardware aligns with reactor/fuel manufacturing; Logistics suits international partnerships.  
- **Efficiency/AI**: Org transformation applicable to streamlining high-stakes ops.  
- **Sectors**: Overlaps in energy-intensive industrial deployments (e.g., Dow).  

Gaps: Limited nuclear/regulatory experience, but transferable from hardware/logistics. Strong for building phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as a proven ops builder in hardware/supply chain-intensive environments, with expertise scaling amid complexity (18 markets, acquisitions) and AI-driven efficiencies. Reference Sell's interviews (e.g., Energy Evolution on Amazon/SMRs) and emphasize accelerating supply chain resilience for 11 GW pipeline. Resonate: "As X-Energy scales Xe-100 deployments with Doosan/SGL, my hardware scaling and AI optimizations can build robust ops to meet AI/data demand without bottlenecks."
