## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Productivity stalls despite automation; volatile supply chains; skilled labor shortages (1.9M unfilled US jobs by 2033); rigid legacy systems; adapting to dynamic/global sites (layout, regulations, demand shifts); compounding change costs in monolithic systems; AI adoption/execution on shop floor.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling global solutions/standardizing processes; integrating AI/composable systems; addressing long-tail challenges; optimizing for agility in volatile chains; building/iterating apps; managing hybrid integrations.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Software-only; no physical infra; platform supports connected devices/machines for data capture.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  Platform addresses high complexity: volatile chains, diverse sites/regulations, demand shifts; enables agile adjustments without monolithic burdens.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  International Marketing Lead (Munich; leadership-adjacent). No explicit ops, Chief of Staff, or senior roles; other: engineering, sales, IT.

  Values: Human-first AI; amplify ingenuity; composable innovation; trust/collaboration; curiosity/diversity. Culture: Innovators solving challenges; global, fast-paced; promotes within; values impact.

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment: Tulip's growth phase (unicorn, global expansion) needs ops scaling; no COO/VP Ops signals opportunity to build function. Your experience scaling markets/P&L matches their 45-country footprint; hardware/AI background fits platform (composable AI for manufacturing); sectors overlap in manufacturing/logistics; desire to BUILD resonates with human-centric innovation.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with building human-centric ops via AI/hardware integration—e.g., "I've scaled ops to 18 markets with AI replacing 150-person teams, aligning with Tulip's frontline amplification." Reference $120M funding/Mitsubishi alliance and Linder's keynote on ingenuity. Outreach to Linder via LinkedIn; resonates with values of curiosity/impact and challenges like volatile chains.
