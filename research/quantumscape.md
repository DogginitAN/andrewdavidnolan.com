# QuantumScape Research

## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  QuantumScape (QS) develops solid-state lithium-metal battery technology for electric vehicles (EVs) and other applications, focusing on higher energy density (e.g., 844 Wh/L), faster charging (10-80% in 12.2 minutes), enhanced safety, and longer life compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries. Their core innovation is an anode-less cell design with a proprietary ceramic separator, addressing EV limitations in range, cost, and performance. The business model is capital-light, emphasizing technology licensing to OEMs and partners for manufacturing scale-up, while QuantumScape handles R&D and pilot production. Revenue will come from royalties, licensing fees, and joint development agreements, starting with automotive EVs but expanding to stationary storage, consumer electronics, and data centers.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Public company (NYSE: QS since 2020), development-stage with no revenue to date (pre-commercial). Nominal revenue expected in 2026 (~$2-5 million from licensing deals). Focused on prototype testing and pilot production.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  As a public company, no recent series funding; relies on equity offerings and partnerships. In July 2024, expanded collaboration with PowerCo (Volkswagen) including a $130 million initial royalty pre-payment (subject to milestones). Cash position: ~$1 billion, runway through 2029. Total raised historically: Over $2 billion pre-IPO, market cap ~$6.7 billion as of December 2025.

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  Approximately 800 full-time employees as of 2024-2025. Growth has been steady from ~350 in 2021, focused on R&D and manufacturing scale-up, with plans for further hiring as production ramps (e.g., Eagle Line operations).

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters: 1730 Technology Drive, San Jose, CA 95110. Additional facilities in San Jose for pilot production. Remote policy not explicitly stated; roles are primarily on-site due to hardware/R&D focus, with potential hybrid for non-lab functions.

- **Key customers or partners.**  
  Key partners: Volkswagen Group (PowerCo for licensing and joint development, $130M royalty deal), unnamed Top-10 global automakers (joint development agreements signed December 2025), Murata Manufacturing and Corning (ceramic separator production), multiple OEMs for testing.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  At development-to-commercial transition, challenges include scaling separator production (e.g., Cobra/Eagle processes), ensuring process consistency/yield, integrating complex machinery, supply chain disruptions for raw materials (lithium, ceramics), regulatory approvals for EVs, cost overruns, and meeting OEM validation timelines amid competition and global demand surges.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In overseeing pilot-to-scale manufacturing (e.g., Eagle Line optimization), improving yield/defect reduction, managing global supply chains/partners, integrating automation/AI for efficiency, controlling costs/P&L during commercialization, and ensuring timely OEM deliveries for 2026 revenue.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manages R&D and pilot facilities in San Jose, CA, including Eagle Line (inaugurated February 2026) for QSE-5 production, Raptor/Cobra processes for separators. Logistics: Global supplier networks for materials; future licensing shifts manufacturing to partners like PowerCo.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Vertical integration for proprietary separators; relies on partners (Murata, Corning) for high-volume ceramics; immature supply for lithium-metal components; manufacturing involves precision automation (e.g., continuous-flow equipment). Distribution via licensing; challenges in throughput, defect control, and global sourcing.

No explicit Chief of Staff or COO listed (COO recently filled).

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Luca Fasoli as COO (October 2024), Geoff Ribar to Board (January 2026). Active hiring in manufacturing/ops (e.g., yield optimization roles) signals building scale-up capabilities for Eagle Line and commercialization.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Dr. Siva Sivaram or COO Luca Fasoli, given small C-suite and Sivaram's hands-on role in strategic hires. Board (e.g., JB Straubel) may influence.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation (revolutionizing energy storage), Sustainability (decarbonized future, lower emissions), Execution (speed in scale-up, milestone-driven), Integrity (data transparency), Employee Growth (skill-building, career mobility). Culture: Mission-driven, collaborative, high-performance; emphasis on diversity, safety, ethics. Position as a builder focused on impact, execution, and cross-functional collaboration.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years in operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design with electrical engineers, AI transformation reducing 150-person org to 2-person, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, focus on BUILDING ops) aligns strongly with QuantumScape's needs. The company is transitioning from R&D to pilot/commercial scale (e.g., Eagle Line), requiring expertise in hardware manufacturing, supply chain optimization, and AI for efficiency—mirroring your hardware/AI background. Your scaling/acquisition experience fits their growth (800 employees) and licensing model expansion. QS offers greenfield ops building (e.g., yield/process improvements), not maintenance, with challenges in global logistics/manufacturing that leverage your sector diversity.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize building scalable hardware ops with AI (e.g., "Scaled custom vehicle ops with engineers and AI-reduced 150-person team to 2, ready to optimize QS's Eagle Line yield/supply chain"). Highlight impact-driven execution: "Built/sold 3 acquisitions, scaled to 18 markets/$25M P&L; eager to drive QS's commercialization for sustainable energy." Reference Sivaram's interviews on scaling milestones (Yahoo Finance on separators, CNBC on partnerships) to show alignment. Resonate by positioning as a collaborator in revolutionizing batteries, emphasizing values like innovation/sustainability.
