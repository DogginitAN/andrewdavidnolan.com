## Operational Landscape

Challenges: Scaling robot manufacturing/assembly; hardware supply chain (sensors, actuators, custom tall structures); rapid global deployments/commissioning; talent acquisition in robotics/AI; customer integration without disruption; post-Series C cash management and efficiency.

Infrastructure: Robot assembly/build (UK onsite); deployment/commissioning at customer warehouses worldwide; remote monitoring via DexoryView; US operations base in Nashville.

Supply chain complexity: High — custom tall robots with specialized components (electrical, sensors, AI hardware, structural), global sourcing, precision engineering, distribution of robots to customer sites.

## Open Roles

- **Chief of Staff (Wallingford)** — OPEN
- Financial Operations Lead
- Commissioning/Service roles
- Head of Sales/Business Development (US, some remote/travel)
- Software/Engineering leadership roles

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment (8.5/10). Hardware experience (custom vehicles with electrical engineers) transfers exceptionally well to robot manufacturing/integration. AI transformation (150→2) resonates with DexoryView platform scaling and agentic AI goals. Multi-market logistics scaling maps to post-Series C global expansion and multi-site deployments. Logistics/CPG background matches core customers (GXO, Maersk, etc.). "BUILD operations" preference ideal — scaling from ~170 people with new US HQ, not maintaining legacy ops. COO exists (Kristen Shannon, Sep 2024), but Chief of Staff is open.

**Strongest angle:** Hardware/electrical engineering experience + AI-driven ops transformation + multi-market logistics scaling. Reference Andrei's podcasts (F1-to-robotics journey, Series C discussions) and mission to "revolutionize warehousing." Position as the operator who builds the scalable backend to deliver on that vision amid rapid post-funding growth. Target Andrei or Kristen directly.
