  Innovation/reimagination of robotics (from hardware-first to general-purpose AI); high-velocity execution/intensity/pragmatism (ex-Tesla influence); feedback-driven; curiosity/impact; entrepreneurial/transformative; rewarding ingenuity. Culture: Exceptional team of pioneers; long-term conviction in omni-bodied intelligence; mission to unlock physical AI at scale. Position as builder thriving in fast-ramp, real-world AI/hardware environments.

## Fit Assessment

Outstanding alignment (9.5/10). Your 15 years scaling operations (18 markets, $25M P&L, 3 acquisitions) directly supports Skild's post-Series C ramp (double deployments/revenue in 2026) and M&A potential. Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical engineers) transfers exceptionally to robotics manufacturing/deployment. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) resonates with optimizing Skild Brain efficiency/adaptation. Logistics/CPG/food/last-mile sectors match target applications (warehouses, delivery, manufacturing). Build-not-maintain preference ideal for early commercial stage (scaling from lab to enterprise/home).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven hardware/AI ops builder accelerating manufacturing/deployment/supply chain scaling amid explosive growth. Resonate: Reference Pathak's interviews on AI brain bottlenecks/shift to general-purpose (Bloomberg/NVIDIA); tie to mission of omni-bodied intelligence, positioning as executor for real-world deployments/resilience, aligning with innovation/velocity culture. Outreach Pathak via LinkedIn, citing $1.4B raise and 2026 doubling goals.
