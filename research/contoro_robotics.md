# Contoro Robotics Research

## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Contoro Robotics develops AI-powered robots that automate the unloading of floor-loaded shipping containers and trailers, focusing on non-palletized boxes. Their technology combines customer-specific AI models, custom grasping techniques (e.g., patented DuoGrasp "beak" for front and side grasping), and human-in-the-loop (HITL) teleoperation to achieve 99%+ success rates in complex, edge-case scenarios. The robots handle boxes 8-30 inches in size and up to 80 pounds, entering trailers autonomously and placing items onto conveyance systems. Core business model: Robots-as-a-Service (RaaS) with pay-per-container pricing, eliminating upfront capital costs for customers and making automation accessible to warehouses of any size. This model supports reliable operations from day one while collecting real-world data to improve AI over time.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Series A stage, private company. Founded in 2022 as a spin-off from medical robotics firm Harmonic Bionics. Revenue: Estimated $5M-$20M annually (2026 data).

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  $12M Series A round closed March 25, 2025, led by Doosan, Coupang, Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, and IMM Investment. Continued participation from SV Investment, KB Investment, Kakao Ventures, and Future Play. Total funding to date: $22M (includes $4.7M Seed in June 2023 and $1.3M Pre-Seed in 2022).

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  35 employees as of early 2026. Founded with 12 staff in 2022; growth has accelerated post-Series A, with active hiring in engineering and operations roles. Trajectory: Rapid scaling, with deployments expanding from pilots in 2023 to multi-state operations by 2026 (e.g., 450+ trailers unloaded in one partnership).

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters: 2601 McHale Court, Suite 160, Austin, TX 78758 (alternative address: 1807 West Braker Lane, Suite C500, Austin, TX 78758). Remote policy: Not explicitly stated, but as a tech startup with deployments across states (CA, TX, IL, NJ, IN), likely supports hybrid or remote for non-field roles, with on-site needs for engineering and operations.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  As a Series A robotics startup scaling deployments, challenges include: Achieving consistent 99%+ reliability across diverse warehouse environments (e.g., varying trailers, box types, shifting loads); managing edge cases requiring HITL intervention; supply chain vulnerabilities for robot components (e.g., arms, grippers, sensors); talent shortages in robotics engineering; regulatory/safety compliance in industrial settings; balancing rapid expansion with cost control amid labor-intensive deployments.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In building scalable deployment processes across states; optimizing supply chain for hardware assembly and maintenance; leading field operations teams for on-site reliability; integrating AI/HITL with customer workflows; driving efficiency metrics (e.g., 20% throughput gains); managing growth risks like panel supplier issues (e.g., grounding errors, tolerances).

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manage robot fleets deployed at customer warehouses (e.g., mobile unloading systems at docks). No owned manufacturing facilities mentioned; likely assemble in Austin HQ or outsource. Logistics: Transport and deploy robots nationwide, with quick setup (5 minutes per unit).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Sourcing specialized components (e.g., industrial arms, AI sensors) vulnerable to shortages; custom manufacturing for grippers and conveyance; distribution involves shipping robots to remote sites, with on-site integration. Recent issues: Panel suppliers missing tolerances or grounding, risking safety.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Director of Business Operations and Strategy (Austin, TX; oversees ops processes, strategy alignment, execution; self-starter with startup ops experience). Robotics Field Technician (Ottawa, IL; on-site ops support). No explicit Chief of Staff or COO roles, but Director role is highest after CEO and could evolve into senior ops leadership.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  No specific recent hires named, but active recruitment in ops (e.g., field techs, business ops director) signals building the function for scaling deployments. Increased focus on automotive and operations roles over the past 12 months.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Youngmok Yun, as no COO exists and the company is founder-led at this stage. He oversees strategy, operations, and growth.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  No dedicated interviews or podcasts found for Yun or team in recent sources. Reference CEO quotes from funding announcements (e.g., March 2025: "Unloading trailers is one of the most physically demanding jobs... We're bringing AI-powered automation that enhances reliability, safety, and efficiency"), or company videos on YouTube (e.g., warehouse automation breakthrough with John Cook discussing labor/safety).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation, reliability, safety, solving real-world labor challenges (e.g., reducing hazards, enabling strategic roles for workers). Culture: Vibrant, diverse team; relentlessly pursues complex challenges; human-centric (HITL emphasizes collaboration over full autonomy). Position as builder of scalable ops in AI/hardware, aligning with their "augmenting intelligence" ethos and growth phase.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery ops to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience designing custom vehicles with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI-powered setup, sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile delivery, desire to BUILD ops) aligns strongly with Contoro's needs as a Series A startup scaling warehouse automation. They lack a dedicated COO/VP Ops, with ops centralized under the CEO and recent hires signaling function build-out. Your scaling expertise matches their multi-state expansion (e.g., from pilots to 450+ trailers unloaded), while hardware/AI experience fits their robot+AI model. Sectors overlap perfectly with their CPG/3PL focus in logistics.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with your proven ability to BUILD ops from scratch in high-growth, tech-driven logistics environments—e.g., "I've scaled last-mile delivery to 18 markets while integrating AI to streamline ops, similar to how Contoro augments robots with HITL for reliability." Reference their labor-safety mission: "Your focus on shifting workers from hazardous tasks resonates with my AI transformation that optimized a 150-person org." Position as a partner to CEO Yun in scaling deployments, citing funding momentum and expansions. Outreach via LinkedIn to Yun or Cook, referencing recent States Logistics milestone to show research. This resonates as they seek self-starters for strategic ops roles amid rapid growth.
