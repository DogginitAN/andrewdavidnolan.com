## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Power supply/costs (renewable sourcing), GPU/component shortages for AI expansion, construction timelines/overruns for GW-scale sites, Bitcoin market volatility, tariff impacts on equipment.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling data center construction/operations, optimizing AI/mining efficiency, managing supply chain for GPUs/power, post-funding execution (e.g., Microsoft contract delivery), cost control.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  6 data centers: Mackenzie BC 80MW, Canal Flats BC 30MW, Prince George BC 50MW, Childress TX 750MW, Sweetwater TX 2,000MW (under construction); total 2,409 acres, 2,910MW secured power (810MW operational).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  ESG-focused (community grants, renewable energy); passionate/global team; excellence in execution/discipline; sustainability/innovation. Position as builder of scalable ops in energy/hardware/AI.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (8/10). Your 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, aligns with IREN's AI/data center expansion (140k GPUs/$3.4B ARR by 2026). Hardware experience transfers to GPU/power infrastructure. AI transformation could optimize mining/AI efficiency. Logistics/CPG/food sectors match supply chain needs. Build-not-maintain preference fits growth phase (AI pivot, site buildouts), though mining has maintenance elements.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of hardware/AI ops in energy-constrained environments, accelerating data center scaling amid AI demand. Resonate: Reference Roberts' comments on AI Cloud acceleration/execution (earnings calls/FreightWaves); tie to sustainability/ESG values, positioning as executor for Microsoft contract and GPU ramp.
