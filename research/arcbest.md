## Operational Landscape
- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Prolonged freight recession leading to lower rates and volumes; manufacturing/housing softness reducing shipment weights; competitive pricing pressures in LTL/truckload; supply chain volatility (e.g., weather, disruptions); cybersecurity risks from hybrid work; balancing growth with cost control amid declining yields (down 3% Q4); integrating asset-based/asset-light for efficiency.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling asset-light brokerage/expedite amid soft rates; optimizing integrated supply chain (mode shifts, pool distribution); driving efficiencies in LTL network via tech (Vaux, TMS); managing facility expansions and cost structures; enhancing cybersecurity/hybrid ops resilience.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  250 campuses/service centers across North America; ABF Freight terminals (expanding with 100+ doors in 2026); warehouses for distribution. Manages owned fleet for LTL, third-party for asset-light.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Multi-modal (LTL, truckload, ocean/air); cross-border (Canada/Mexico); integrates asset/asset-light for closed-loop supply chains; handles diverse freight (general commodities, high-value); complexity in mode optimization, vendor consolidation, pool distribution amid volatility; no direct manufacturing but supports manufacturers' logistics.

## Open Roles
- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Open roles include: Manager Inventory Control (Fort Smith, AR); Logistics Manager (various locations); Director of Operations (asset-light, remote hybrid); Senior Supply Chain Analyst (Fort Smith); VP Yield Management (strategy/ops hybrid). No explicit COO, VP Ops, Chief of Staff openings, but ops-focused roles signal building efficiency functions. ~20 ops-related postings as of early 2026.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function)**  
  Mac Pinkerton (COO Asset-Light, January 2026); Christopher Adkins (Chief Strategy Officer, January 2025); Eddie Sorg (Chief Commercial Officer, January 2025). Signals building asset-light ops, strategy, and commercial functions for growth/efficiency.

## Outreach Intel
- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists)**  
  CEO Seth Runser (strategic oversight) or COO Mac Pinkerton (asset-light focus, but company-wide ops likely CEO-led).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - Seth Runser: CNBC Mad Money (September 2025, with Judy McReynolds on transition/outlook); Trucking Dive interview (December 17, 2025: Growth, efficiency, innovation).  
  - Judy McReynolds: CNBC Squawk Box (state of freight/supply chain); YouTube video on legacy/transition (November 2025); Mad Money on Investor Day (September 2025). Reference values-driven culture, innovation (Vaux), and navigating recession.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: People-first, integrity, innovation, growth, efficiency, customer-centric (solve challenges, keep supply chains moving). Culture: Values-driven, collaborative, resilient; emphasis on empathy, autonomy for top talent, diversity/inclusion. Position as builder aligning with mission to innovate logistics, support team growth.

## Fit Assessment
The candidate's profile aligns strongly with ArcBest's operational needs amid recession recovery and expansion. 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets with $25M P&L, directly matches LTL/truckload growth (e.g., shipments up 2.4%, facility expansions). Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical engineers) translates to fleet/tech integration (Vaux, TMS). AI transformation (150-to-2 person org) could drive efficiencies in asset-light brokerage and supply chain optimization. Sectors (logistics, last-mile, CPG) overlap with ArcBest's core (manufacturers, retailers, e-commerce). Desire to BUILD ops fits facility/network ramp-up and innovation focus, not just maintenance.

Potential gaps: Limited public company experience, but scaling/acquisitions bridge this; no direct LTL, but logistics expertise mitigates.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize building scalable logistics from scratch, tying AI/hardware to ArcBest's tech (e.g., "Scaled last-mile ops with AI, slashing headcount—eager to optimize ABF network/Vaux for 100+ door expansions"). Reference Runser's interviews (e.g., Trucking Dive on efficiency) and McReynolds' legacy (CNBC on supply chain revamp) to connect acquisitions to mission: "Ready to build integrated ops accelerating growth in recession, aligning with people-first culture." Highlight values like innovation/resilience; outreach via LinkedIn to Runser/Pinkerton, citing Q4 earnings/facility news for timeliness.
