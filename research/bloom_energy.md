## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Supply chain vulnerabilities (component shortages, geopolitical risks); scaling manufacturing to meet AI demand without delays; grid constraints driving customer urgency but increasing execution risks; high cycling degrading fuel cell stacks; cost per kWh vs. competitors (e.g., Chinese manufacturers); talent shortages in skilled manufacturing; permitting and cooling/water issues for large deployments.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling supply chain and manufacturing capacity (e.g., from 1GW to 2GW); optimizing operations for rapid deployments (e.g., 50MW in 55 days); managing NPI and backlog execution ($20B total); enhancing efficiency to improve margins; leading talent acquisition for skilled roles.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manufacturing facilities: Fremont, CA (main consolidation site); Sunnyvale, CA (60,000 sq ft facility vacated Q1 2025); plans for expansion to 2GW capacity. Logistics: Global supply chain for components, on-site installations for customers (e.g., data centers).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Reliant on global vendors for fuel cell components (risk of bottlenecks); reshoring efforts to mitigate Asia dependencies; manual processes transitioning to automation; distribution involves rapid on-site deployments; geopolitical/security risks in supply chain.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  No specific senior operations (COO/VP Ops) or Chief of Staff roles listed; however, openings in operations include Operations Supervisor (Florence, KY), Manufacturing Engineering Director (Electronics, overseeing NPI/production), and Supply Chain/Operations Manager roles. Signals focus on mid-level ops build-out for scaling.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Aaron Hoover (Head of Business Development, August 2025); Satish Chitoori (COO, in role since 2023, active in scaling). Signals building ops for manufacturing expansion and AI demand.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO KR Sridhar, as founder-led with oversight of strategy and operations; COO Satish Chitoori may co-decide.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  KR Sridhar: CNBC "The Exchange" (Jan 8, 2026: AI energy deployment); WSJ Davos (Jan 22, 2026: AI can't rely on grid); "AI Made Electricity Reinvent" podcast (Sep 17, 2025); CNBC full interview (Sep 24, 2025: AI energy); Fox Business (Oct 14, 2025: AI power future; Jan 20, 2026: AI dominance via energy).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Clean reliable energy for all; performance-driven, enduring design, forward-thinking innovation, pushing science frontiers, diversity of thought/experience. Culture: Collaborative teams solving global energy challenges; emphasis on curiosity, growth, inclusivity. Position as a builder of scalable, resilient ops aligning with AI/energy innovation.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI setup, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, desire to BUILD ops) aligns well with Bloom Energy's growth phase amid AI power demand. They lack a dedicated VP Ops below COO, signaling opportunity to build function for scaling (e.g., 2GW capacity, $20B backlog). Your hardware/AI expertise fits fuel cell manufacturing and data center ops; multi-market scaling matches geographic expansion.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with building scalable ops in hardware/AI-constrained environments—e.g., "I've scaled logistics across 18 markets with AI optimizations, similar to Bloom's rapid fuel cell deployments for AI data centers." Highlight resiliency: "Your grid-independent power mission aligns with my supply chain transformations amid bottlenecks." Reference Sridhar's interviews (e.g., Jan 2026 CNBC on AI energy urgency). Outreach to Sridhar via LinkedIn, positioning as partner for 2026 expansion. Resonates with innovation/diversity values and execution challenges.
