# Oklo Inc. (OKLO) — Research

*Source: Grok | Date: February 5, 2026*

## Company Profile

Oklo Inc. designs and develops small modular reactors (SMRs) using advanced fast fission technology to provide clean, reliable, and affordable nuclear energy. Core products include the Aurora Powerhouse reactor (up to 75 MWe) and larger VIPR reactors. Also focuses on nuclear fuel recycling and radioisotope production for medical/industrial use. Business model is "build, own, and operate" — deploy power plants and sell electricity/heat directly to customers, with vertical integration in fuel supply chain.

- **Stage:** Public (NYSE: OKLO), pre-commercial. No revenue as of Q3 2025. Targeting first commercial deployment 2027, possible delays to 2030.
- **Revenue:** Pre-revenue (development stage)
- **Employees:** 113 full-time (Dec 2024), up from 99 in 2023 and 20 in 2020. Employees across 29 U.S. states.
- **HQ:** Santa Clara, CA. Remote-friendly with hybrid/remote opportunities.

Press: CNBC (Jan 12, 2026) on Meta deal; Wired (Jan 9, 2026) "Meta Is Making a Big Bet on Nuclear With Oklo"; Bloomberg (Jan 14, 2026) CEO warns of labor shortages; Politico (Oct 20, 2025) $2B fuel plant investment.

Controversies: NRC denied 2020 reactor application in 2022 for insufficient safety details. Regulatory delays, HALEU supply shortages, high costs (fuel 4.7x assumed price), labor gaps.

## Operational Landscape

- Regulatory hurdles (NRC licensing delays, potential to 2029+)
- HALEU fuel supply constraints (limited domestic production, geopolitical risks)
- High capital costs ($2.4B estimated for plants, 135% overruns possible)
- Skilled labor shortages for construction
- Scaling fuel recycling and manufacturing amid novelty
- Cash burn requiring financing
- Sites: Idaho (first Aurora plant, fuel fab at INL), Ohio (1.2 GW campus), potential co-located fuel facilities
- Transport of HALEU/plutonium, reactor modules to remote/data center sites

## Open Roles

- Manufacturing Center of Excellence Senior Director (leadership in ops/manufacturing)
- Director/Senior Director of Project Management (ops leadership)
- Operations Engineer II
- People Operations Coordinator
- HR Business Partner
- FP&A Manager
- No explicit VP Ops or Chief of Staff, but signals building ops functions

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment (8/10). Pre-commercial company building operations from ground up in complex, regulated sector. Scaling delivery to 18 markets and $25M P&L relevant to deploying SMRs across sites. Hardware experience (custom vehicles with electrical engineers) mirrors integrating advanced reactor tech. AI transformation resonates with optimizing fuel recycling and ops efficiency amid labor shortages. COO exists (Caroline DeWitte), so angle is more about supporting/complementing the ops buildout than replacing.

**Strongest angle:** Proven builder of scalable ops in emerging tech/hardware environments, emphasizing AI-driven efficiency and multi-market rollouts. Reference CNBC interviews on growth/partnerships. Tie to their culture of bold innovation and "abundant, affordable energy" mission. Highlight how acquisition/scaling experience can accelerate 2027-2030 deployments.
