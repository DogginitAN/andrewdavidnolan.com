## Operational Landscape

Challenges: Scaling hardware deployments (1,000+ towers nationwide), custom hardware manufacturing/supply chain, integration with diverse client systems, nationwide installation logistics, handling 20,000+ pallets daily / $200M inventory flow.

Where senior ops adds value: Managing rapid deployment scaling, optimizing hardware supply chain/manufacturing, ensuring seamless integrations, automating back-office operations, field operations management.

Infrastructure: 1,000+ AI camera towers deployed at loading docks nationwide, forklift add-ons (Kargo Lift), installation operations across US warehouses.

## Open Roles

- Field Operations Deployment Manager (manage deployments/installations, travel required)
- Enterprise Account Executive, Growth Manager, Backend Engineer Intern, Content Marketer
- No COO, VP Ops, or Chief of Staff listed — but Field Ops Deployment Manager signals building the function

## Fit Assessment

Very high alignment (9/10). Direct logistics experience overlap — your custom vehicle fleet + last-mile delivery maps directly to their hardware deployment + field operations challenges. AI transformation story resonates with their automation mission. Hardware engineering (custom vehicles with electrical engineers) parallels their custom vision towers/sensors. 45+ enterprise customers scaling nationally = exactly the 0→1→100 pattern you've done before.

No COO, no CoS, no CFO — founder-led with significant leadership gaps post-Series B. This is ground-floor ops building.

**Strongest angle:** You've literally done the hardware+software+logistics integration they need — custom vehicles with sensors, fleet deployment across markets, real-time monitoring systems. Reference Lurye's podcast on data challenges. The Dexory partnership creates a warm connection if you're pursuing both.
