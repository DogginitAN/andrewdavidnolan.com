## Company Profile
- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Redwood Materials specializes in battery recycling, recovering critical minerals (lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper) from end-of-life batteries and manufacturing battery components like cathode active material. It has expanded into deploying large-scale energy storage systems using new and repurposed EV batteries for data centers, AI infrastructure, and grid applications. The core model is a closed-loop supply chain: collecting batteries nationwide, recycling 95-98% of materials, producing components for resale, and repurposing usable packs for storage, reducing reliance on foreign mining and creating domestic sources of critical minerals.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known)**  
  Series E, private company. Valuation over $6B post-Series E (January 2026). Revenue approximately $200M in 2024; no 2025-2026 figures publicly available, but operations scaled to 60,000 metric tons of critical minerals produced in 2025.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors)**  
  - January 28, 2026: Final close of $425M Series E (upsized from $350M), led by Eclipse, with participation from NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm), Google (new investor), Capricorn, and Goldman Sachs Alternatives.  
  - October 23, 2025: Initial $350M Series E announcement.  
  Prior: Over $1B Series D in 2023; $2B DOE loan commitment in 2023.

- **Employee count and growth trajectory**  
  Approximately 1,200 employees as of early 2026 (down from peak after ~60 layoffs in November 2025, representing 5% of workforce). Growth: 11% year-over-year in 2025, but recent cuts amid pivot to energy storage and restructuring. Hiring continues in operations and manufacturing, signaling targeted expansion.

- **Headquarters and remote policy**  
  Headquarters in Carson City, NV. Facilities in McCarran, NV; Ridgeville, SC; San Francisco, CA (R&D center opened April 2025). No explicit remote policy stated, but multi-site operations and tech focus suggest hybrid flexibility for non-manufacturing roles.

- **Key customers or partners**  
  Customers/partners: Crusoe (AI data center microgrid), Volkswagen Group of America, Panasonic, GM/Ultium Cells, Volvo, Amazon, Toyota, Southern Company, BMW of North America, Ford, Lyft. Processes 20 GWh of batteries annually (equivalent to 250,000 EVs), representing 90% of North American lithium-ion recycling.

  Scaling energy storage for AI/data centers and grid (e.g., hyperscalers, renewables). South Carolina facility online November 2025 (20,000 MT capacity). Nevada Campus expansion (2M sq ft). Targeting international but focus on U.S. sovereignty. Headcount: Post-layoffs hiring in ops/manufacturing; overall growth tied to storage deployments.

## Operational Landscape
- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling advanced recycling while maintaining high recovery rates and quality; competing with low-cost Chinese batteries devaluing recycled materials; supply chain disruptions from trade tensions (e.g., tariffs on rare earths); regulatory changes impacting costs; capital-intensive expansion amid policy uncertainties; integrating diverse battery chemistries; managing hazardous materials safely (no incidents, but inherent risks).

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing supply chain and logistics for battery collection/recycling; scaling manufacturing at Nevada/SC facilities; driving efficiencies in energy storage deployment (e.g., repurposing packs quickly); cost reduction through AI/automation in sorting/refining; navigating regulatory/compliance for hazardous materials.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Nevada Campus (McCarran/Carson City: 2M sq ft across 900 acres for recycling/manufacturing); Ridgeville, SC facility (critical minerals recovery, 20,000 MT/year); San Francisco, CA R&D center. Nationwide logistics network for collecting 20 GWh batteries annually.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Processes batteries from various manufacturers/chemistries; global dependencies but domestic focus to counter China (e.g., friend-shoring); logistics for hazardous materials; manufacturing cathode from recycled inputs; distribution of storage systems to data centers/utilities. Challenges include long-distance material flows (tens of thousands of miles avoided via closed-loop) and achieving cost parity with mining.

## Open Roles
- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes, multiple ops-focused: Manager Inventory Control (McCarran, NV); Manager Logistics (McCarran, NV); Manufacturing Quality Engineer, Energy Storage (McCarran, NV); Production Engineer, Mechanical (McCarran, NV); Controls Technician (McCarran, NV); Senior Controls Engineer (Ridgeville, SC); Director of Construction, EPC (McCarran, NV); Senior Construction Manager, Self Perform Electrical (McCarran, NV); and others in manufacturing/test/infrastructure. No explicit Chief of Staff, VP Ops, or COO openings.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function)**  
  No specific recent ops/leadership hires reported. Layoffs in November 2025, but ongoing hiring in ops/manufacturing (e.g., inventory, logistics, construction) signals building for energy storage scaling and facility expansions.

## Outreach Intel
- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists)**  
  CEO JB Straubel (strategic oversight) or COO Chris Lister (operations focus).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - JB Straubel: March 9, 2025 - Ride the Lightning Podcast (Tesla early days, recycling); February 11, 2025 - Bold Names WSJ Podcast (recycling bet); June 27, 2025 - CNBC interview (EV batteries for AI data centers); September 19, 2025 - BNEF Summit Houston (critical minerals/storage); July 16, 2025 - MIT Symposium (scaling challenges); September 18, 2025 - Bloomberg interview (batteries with gas plants).  
  - Colin Campbell (CTO): July 24, 2025 - Latitude Media Catalyst podcast (second-life batteries). Reference scaling from Tesla, domestic supply chains, and AI/energy demands.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Sustainability, innovation, U.S. energy independence, circular economy, resource efficiency (e.g., low-energy recycling validated by Nature study). Culture: Mission-driven, execution-oriented, focused on impact (e.g., powering AI/grid, reducing emissions). Position as builder of resilient ops aligning with closed-loop goals and rapid scaling.

## Fit Assessment
The candidate's 15 years in operations, including scaling to 18 markets with $25M P&L and 3 acquisitions/exits, aligns well with Redwood's growth from recycling to energy storage deployments amid $6B+ valuation and expansions. Hardware experience (custom vehicles with engineers) translates to battery manufacturing/refining complexities. AI transformation (150-to-2 person org) could optimize sorting/logistics in recycling. Sectors (logistics, CPG, last-mile) overlap with battery collection/distribution. Desire to BUILD ops fits Redwood's scaling phase (e.g., SC facility, storage pivot), not maintenance.

Potential gaps: Limited direct recycling/energy experience, but hardware/AI bridges this; no hazardous materials background, but logistics expertise mitigates.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize building scalable, closed-loop ops from scratch, tying to your AI efficiencies (e.g., "Transformed 150-person ops to AI-driven 2-person team—ready to optimize Redwood's battery sorting/recycling for 20 GWh scale"). Reference Straubel's podcasts (e.g., CNBC on AI storage, WSJ on recycling) to connect your acquisitions to Redwood's mission: "Eager to architect ops accelerating U.S. mineral independence and AI/grid power, mirroring Tesla's scaling ethos." Highlight values like sustainability/innovation; outreach via LinkedIn to Straubel/Lister, citing recent funding/SC launch for timeliness.
