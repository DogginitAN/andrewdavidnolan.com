- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  International (Singapore, Taiwan, Europe/Ukraine, space domain); aggressive hiring (hundreds of roles) for production, deployed ops, and autonomy integration; new facilities implied via scaling.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling hardware production/safety for drones (post-incident scrutiny), managing complex defense supply chains/contracting, field deployments in contested environments, integrating autonomy across partner platforms, and rapid growth amid regulatory/DoD timelines.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Building scalable manufacturing/supply chain for V-BAT/X-BAT, optimizing deployed field operations (e.g., site leads/crews), improving logistics for global deployments, integrating AI for operational efficiency, and navigating defense contracting/P&L during commercialization ramp.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manufacturing/testing facilities (San Diego, Dallas); deployed drone fleets for customers (e.g., USCG, international); logistics for field operations in remote/contested areas.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Defense-grade hardware (drones, sensors), global sourcing amid tariffs, partner integrations (e.g., RTX, HII), and field distribution to military sites with strict compliance/safety requirements.

## Open Roles

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling delivery to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware design with electrical engineers, AI transformation reducing 150-person org to 2-person, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, focus on BUILDING ops) aligns strongly with Shield AI's needs. The company is scaling hardware/autonomy production and deployed operations in defense—leveraging your hardware engineering experience, AI efficiency gains, and logistics scaling. Acquisition background fits partner integrations; greenfield build phase matches rapid growth/post-incident ops strengthening.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Lead with hardware scaling and AI optimization in complex environments (e.g., "Designed custom vehicles with engineers and AI-transformed 150-person ops to lean model—ready to scale Shield AI's V-BAT/X-BAT production and deployed autonomy"). Emphasize mission impact: "Built/sold 3 companies scaling logistics globally; eager to build ops protecting lives in contested battlespaces." Reference Tseng interviews (e.g., Shawn Ryan on X-BAT, CSIS on DoD autonomy) and Steele's Fortune piece on global demand to show alignment. Resonate by positioning as a partner accelerating their "protect with intelligence" mission through execution speed and safety-focused scaling.
