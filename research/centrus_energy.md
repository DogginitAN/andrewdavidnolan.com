## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Centrus Energy Corp. (LEU) is a supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry. It focuses on enriching uranium to produce Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) for commercial reactors and High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) for advanced reactors. The core business model includes long-term supply agreements for enriched uranium fuel (sourced from primary producers, secondary markets, and inventory), advanced manufacturing and engineering services for nuclear components, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and development of uranium enrichment technology in partnership with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Revenue streams come from LEU sales (SWU and uranium components), technical solutions (contracts like HALEU production), and services emphasizing safety, compliance, and national security.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  At this growth stage (expanding domestic enrichment amid U.S. Russia ban), challenges include geopolitical supply risks (e.g., phasing out Russian LEU by 2028), supply chain disruptions (e.g., shortages for HALEU cylinders), high capital costs for multi-billion expansions, regulatory approvals/compliance for nuclear ops, attracting specialized talent (e.g., for Piketon/Oak Ridge), and technological hurdles in scaling centrifuge production.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In scaling facility expansions (Piketon/ Oak Ridge), optimizing domestic supply chains (14 suppliers), managing logistics for nuclear materials transport, ensuring safety/compliance in high-stakes environments, and driving efficiency in centrifuge manufacturing/HALEU production amid shortages. Value in building resilient ops to meet $3.9B backlog and contingent $2.3B LEU commitments.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manages American Centrifuge Plant (Piketon, OH: HALEU/LEU production, 150,000 sq ft new facility); Oak Ridge, TN manufacturing (centrifuges, expanded in 2025). Logistics: Nationwide supply chain for components; transportation of enriched uranium (requires specialized cylinders, compliance with nuclear regs).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Relies on domestic chain (13 states, 14 suppliers) for centrifuges; outsourcing uranium but shifting to in-house enrichment. Distribution: Secure transport of nuclear fuel (LEU/HALEU) to utilities/DOE. Risks: Sanctions/tariffs on imports, cylinder shortages, geopolitical disruptions; scaling to 3.5M SWU capacity by 2030s.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Careers page shows limited details, but no explicit openings for VP Ops, COO, Chief of Staff, or senior ops leadership as of latest check. Focus on expansion-related roles (e.g., engineering, manufacturing in OH/TN). General hiring for 300+ ops jobs in Piketon and 430 in Oak Ridge to support growth.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Todd Tinelli (CFO, August 2025) signals finance/ops build for expansions. No direct ops hires noted, but executive transitions (e.g., CFO change) and facility ramps indicate building ops capacity for scale-up.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Amir Vexler (oversees strategy and expansions). Secondary: Patrick Brown (SVP Field Operations, manages site ops).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  CEO Amir Vexler: Fox Business (January 2026 on DOE award); CNBC (October 16, 2025 on global nuclear demand); Plugged In podcast (October 6, 2025 on supply chains); Bloomberg Intelligence podcast (2025 on AI/nuclear); YouTube interviews (e.g., role in climate solutions, restoring U.S. enrichment). Former CEO Daniel Poneman: Podcasts on Ukraine implications (2022), World Nuclear Association interview.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Safety, regulatory compliance, innovation in nuclear tech, national/energy security, public-private partnerships, non-proliferation. Culture: Emphasis on restoring U.S. nuclear leadership, teamwork in high-stakes environments, commitment to clean energy. Position as: Builder focused on scaling secure, compliant ops in strategic sectors, aligning with national security and innovation goals.

## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience (custom vehicles with engineers), AI transformation (150-to-2 person org), sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile, and desire to build ops—alignment with Centrus is moderate to strong (7/10). Centrus is in expansion mode, building uranium enrichment infrastructure amid U.S. energy security push, mirroring your scaling expertise. Your hardware and supply chain background fits centrifuge manufacturing/logistics; AI efficiency could optimize nuclear ops. However, nuclear sector's regulatory/safety demands differ from your experience, and ops here involve specialized tech/security.

Key alignments:  
- **Scaling/building ops**: Centrus needs to build multi-billion facilities (Piketon/Oak Ridge), similar to your market expansions and acquisitions.  
- **Hardware/supply chain**: Custom hardware design aligns with centrifuge production; logistics experience suits nuclear transport.  
- **Efficiency/AI**: Your AI org reduction could apply to streamlining enrichment processes.  
- **Sectors**: Logistics overlaps with supply chain diversification from Russia.  

Gaps: No direct nuclear/energy experience; high compliance stakes. Overall, strong for building phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as a proven ops builder in hardware/logistics-heavy environments, with track record scaling amid complexity (18 markets, $25M P&L, acquisitions). Reference Vexler's interviews on U.S. nuclear independence (e.g., Fox Business on DOE award) and emphasize how your AI/hardware expertise can accelerate secure, domestic supply chains. Resonate: "As Centrus expands Piketon to meet $3.9B backlog and reduce Russian reliance, my scaling of hardware ops and AI efficiencies can build resilient infrastructure for national security."
