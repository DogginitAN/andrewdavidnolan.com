## Recent News & Momentum (Last 6 months)

- **Major announcements (funding, partnerships, product launches).**  
  February 3, 2026: Q2 FY2026 results ($12.7B revenue) and raised FY2026 guidance to $40B+.  
  January 2026: Support for NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72/HGX; intelligent retail solutions with partners.  
  January 6, 2026: Super AI Station and edge AI PCs launch.  
  Ongoing: Large-scale Blackwell Ultra shipments; rack-scale liquid-cooled expansions.

- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  Reuters/CNBC (Feb 2026): Raised guidance amid strong AI demand; stock surge on restored investor faith.  
  Positive focus on revenue acceleration and order strength.

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  Past (2024): Accounting allegations (Hindenburg report, special committee found no fraud); filing delays resolved. Current: Margin pressures from competition/supply chain; tariff risks on global manufacturing.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  Expanded US/Taiwan manufacturing (millions sq ft added historically; ongoing rack-scale capacity for liquid cooling); global support in 100+ countries. Headcount growth to support $40B guidance and AI deployments.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Supply chain concentration (heavy NVIDIA dependency); component shortages/tariffs impacting costs; margin compression from competition; scaling high-volume manufacturing amid explosive AI demand; global logistics for custom racks.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing global supply chain/manufacturing velocity; driving efficiency in rack integration/liquid cooling deployments; managing post-retirement ops transition; leveraging AI for internal ops amid growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Over 6M sq ft global manufacturing (US Silicon Valley Green Computing Park, Taiwan Science/Technology Park ~800K sq ft new); clean energy automated rack facilities; data center building blocks for customer deployments.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Vertically integrated but reliant on key suppliers (NVIDIA GPUs); global sourcing/manufacturing (US/Taiwan/Europe); custom high-performance systems with rapid innovation cycles; risks from shortages, tariffs, competition.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Hundreds open globally (e.g., 580+ on LinkedIn, 197 on Glassdoor); operations roles include managers/supervisors, technical program managers, supply chain. No explicit COO/VP Ops/Chief of Staff; signals ongoing needs in engineering/scaling but not C-suite ops.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Ops transition post-Kao retirement (Tom Xiao assuming duties); focus on engineering/scaling leadership amid growth.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Charles Liang (founder-led, hands-on in operations/innovation).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Charles Liang: CNBC interviews (e.g., July 2025 on tariffs/demand); YouTube firesides (RAISE Summit July 2025, HumanX March 2025, Innovate! May 2025 keynote); earnings calls (e.g., Q2 2026 Feb 2026).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Innovation/first-to-market; green computing/environmental focus ("We Keep IT Green"); people-centric ("success around committed people"); high-velocity execution. Position as builder driving scalable hardware ops for AI growth.

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment (8.5/10). Your 15 years scaling operations (18 markets, $25M P&L, acquisitions) aligns with SMCI's high-growth AI server ramp and global manufacturing expansions. Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical) highly transferable to rack-scale/GPU systems. AI transformation expertise could optimize internal efficiency amid supply pressures. Logistics/last-mile background relevant to distribution challenges. Build focus fits scaling phase, though mature public company has some maintenance elements.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Hardware/AI ops scaler who accelerates manufacturing/supply chain velocity for explosive demand (e.g., $40B guidance). Resonate: Reference Liang's talks on AI boom/tariffs (CNBC/YouTube); position as driver of green/efficient rack integration, aligning with innovation and environmental mission. Outreach Charles Liang directly, citing Q2 results and Blackwell momentum.
