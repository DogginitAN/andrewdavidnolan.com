## Recent News & Momentum (Last 6 months)

- **Major announcements (funding, partnerships, product launches).**  
  - February 19, 2025: Celebrated one-year partnership with Dot Foods, achieving 85% improvement in cycle sell-through rate, reduced holding costs, and 10x expansion in active buyer network.  
  - No new funding or product launches in the last 6 months (August 2025-February 2026). Earlier: Recognized in the 2024 ProcureTech100 for innovation in supply chain solutions (announced late 2024).  
  - Platform enhancements: Continued focus on smart awarding logistics algorithm (launched September 2023, but ongoing iterations).

- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  - Positive: Coverage on Dot Foods partnership (Dot Foods newsroom, February 2025) highlighting efficiency gains in redistribution. Recognition in ProcureTech100 (2024) for secondary market innovation. Earlier press (e.g., AgFunderNews on 2021 funding) emphasizes waste reduction impact (over 500,000 tons of product diverted from landfills).  
  - Industry mentions: Featured in CPG reports on excess inventory management (e.g., 2025 Year in Review Report by Spoiler Alert, focusing on turning excess into profit).

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  No controversies reported. Challenges: Broader CPG industry issues like seasonality, supply chain volatility, and excess inventory costs (hidden drags on margins and operations, as noted in company resources). Company addresses these through tech but faces competition in waste prevention software.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  No new facilities or markets announced. Focus on team expansion (post-2021 funding used for hiring) and platform features (e.g., Command Center for real-time data visibility). Emphasis on U.S. CPG market growth, with potential for international via partners like Maersk. Headcount growth implied through remote-first hiring for sales, customer success, and tech roles.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  As a Series A SaaS company in CPG tech, challenges include managing unpredictable seasonal demand shifts leading to overstock/understock, manual workflows causing inefficiencies, logistics complexities in secondary markets (e.g., truck building and freight optimization), labor instability from resignations/layoffs in supply chain, data visibility gaps for excess inventory, and broader CPG issues like rising holding costs, waste reduction pressures, and competition from fragmented discounting processes.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In scaling platform operations for growth, automating supply chain workflows to handle increasing customer volume, optimizing logistics algorithms for efficiency (e.g., reducing costs via smart awarding), enhancing data integration for real-time insights, and leading expansion into new CPG categories or buyer networks. Value in building resilient systems to turn excess inventory into profit centers, aligning with sustainability goals.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  No owned physical infrastructure; operates as a software platform. Facilitates virtual logistics through algorithms for truck planning and freight optimization in the secondary CPG supply chain.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Focuses on perishable CPG products with short shelf lives, requiring digitized liquidation to secondary channels. Involves global sourcing dependencies, seasonal volatility, and multi-node coordination (manufacturers to wholesalers/retailers). Platform addresses this with automation, but challenges include fragmented data, manual awarding, and high expediting costs (industry-wide $1.5M daily disruption estimates).

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  No explicit openings for COO, VP Operations, Chief of Staff, or senior ops leadership listed on the careers page (as of latest crawl). General opportunities in sales, customer success, and tech (e.g., software engineering). Emphasis on roles supporting platform growth, such as supply chain specialists.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Art Dirik hired as VP of Customer Success (signals building customer/ops support). No other recent ops hires specified, but post-2021 funding focused on team expansion indicates ongoing building of operations and success functions for scale.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Ricky Ashenfelter (as primary leader in a small, founder-led company).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - Ricky Ashenfelter: VentureFizz YouTube interview (January 4, 2022) on company details, growth, and culture (discusses B2B waste prevention, perishable CPG focus, and market supply side).  
  - No recent (2025-2026) podcasts found; earlier appearances emphasize waste reduction and supply chain innovation.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Powering a waste-free economy; people, planet, and profits (e.g., diverting 500,000+ tons from landfills); integrity in solving environmental/social challenges; data-driven supply chain excellence. Culture: Collaborative ("working together, winning together"), innovative, purpose-driven; remote-first with emphasis on trust, efficiency, and impact. Position as a sustainability-focused builder who digitizes and scales ops, aligning with "rescue, redistribute, repeat" ethos.

## Fit Assessment

The candidate's profile aligns strongly with Spoiler Alert's growth-stage needs in CPG tech, waste reduction, and supply chain optimization. With 15 years in operations, 3 acquisitions (built/sold), scaling to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design (transferable to logistics tech), and AI transformation (reducing 150-person org to 2), the candidate matches Spoiler Alert's focus on digitizing excess inventory management and automating workflows. Sectors (food service, logistics, CPG, last-mile) directly overlap with Spoiler Alert's perishable CPG emphasis, where seasonality and efficiency are key challenges. The desire to "BUILD operations" fits a Series A company expanding its platform and partnerships (e.g., Dot Foods), needing to scale from manual to AI-enhanced systems.

Challenges like excess inventory costs and logistics complexity would benefit from the candidate's scaling expertise in volatile markets.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Lead with CPG/logistics scaling and AI transformation—reducing teams via AI aligns with digitizing liquidation and waste prevention (reference 85% sell-through gains in Dot Foods partnership). Tie acquisitions/hardware exp to building resilient secondary channels. Position as a purpose-driven builder: "I've scaled ops in CPG-adjacent sectors to drive efficiency and sustainability; let's build Spoiler Alert's waste-free future with innovative, data-powered operations." Reference Ashenfelter's VentureFizz interview on supply-side focus to show alignment. Outreach to Ashenfelter via LinkedIn, citing shared MIT ecosystem or sustainability values for relevance.
