## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI setup, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, desire to BUILD ops) aligns strongly with Together AI's post-Series B growth phase. They lack a dedicated COO/VP Ops, with ops under Director level, signaling opportunity to build the function amid $300M ARR and global scaling. Your hardware/AI experience fits their GPU cloud infra and efficiency focus (e.g., "do more with less"), while logistics scaling transfers to multi-region cloud ops. Overlap in AI transformation supports their open-source model optimization.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Lead with your expertise in BUILDING scalable ops in AI/hardware environments—e.g., "I've scaled logistics ops across 18 markets while integrating AI to optimize teams, mirroring Together's efficient GPU cloud and open-source ethos." Highlight alignment with values: "Your focus on innovation and stewardship resonates with my AI transformations that enhanced efficiency and societal impact." Reference recent funding/partnerships (e.g., $305M Series B, Meta collab) to show research. Outreach to CEO Vipul via LinkedIn, positioning as a strategic partner for infrastructure scaling. This resonates with their founder-led, curiosity-driven culture and rapid growth needs.
