# Bear Robotics Research

## Company Profile
- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Bear Robotics develops AI-powered autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for hospitality, food service, warehouses, factories, and logistics. Key products include the Servi series (for serving, bussing, and delivery in restaurants/hotels, navigating narrow paths like 21.6 inches) and Carti series (for material handling, inventory transport, with 66-220 lb capacity and 12-hour battery). The core model focuses on selling/leasing robots to automate repetitive tasks, enabling multi-robot fleets with centralized control (ACS), seamless WMS integration, and AI navigation to boost efficiency, reduce labor costs (e.g., 8,758 meters/150 deliveries daily in deployments), and scale operations across industries.

## Operational Landscape
- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Post-acquisition integration with LG; scaling mass production (FASSTO prep); global supply chain for batteries/hardware; adapting robots to diverse environments (e.g., narrow paths, multi-floors); competition in AMRs; ensuring AI safety/efficiency in high-volume deployments (e.g., 30-robot sites).

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing global supply chain/manufacturing post-LG; scaling distribution/partnerships (e.g., Japan/Europe); building multi-robot ops for warehouses/hospitality; driving efficiency in production/logistics to meet demand.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  HQ/facilities in Redwood City, CA; Korea (Seoul); Japan; Europe (Dublin); Addison, TX (sales/distribution, 12,857 sq ft, 25 employees). Manages robot fleets in client sites (e.g., warehouses, restaurants).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Relies on LG for batteries (MoU); FASSTO for mass production; global distribution via partners (BlueStar, Jestic). Challenges: Hardware scaling, AI integration across chemistries/environments, hazardous material logistics (batteries), cost parity with competitors.

## Open Roles
- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Careers page insufficient; no explicit ops, Chief of Staff, or leadership openings listed. General expansion signals roles in sales, distribution, engineering.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function)**  
  No specifics reported. Building via partnerships (e.g., sales/distribution hires in Addison 2021, Dublin 2023).

## Outreach Intel
- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists)**  
  CEO John Ha or COO Juan Higueros.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - John Ha: Smart Kitchen Summit 2018 (Penny robot); Robot & AI Keynote 2018 (hospitality future hype/reality).  
  - Juan Higueros: TEConnect Podcast #213 (robot market potential, opportunities for VARs); Restaurant Rockstars Podcast (March 2025, automation/future of restaurants). Reference innovation, efficiency, human empowerment.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation, efficiency, collaboration, human empowerment (automate repetitive tasks). Culture: Mission-driven, super collaborative, legit/credible (per Higueros). Position as builder of scalable AI/hardware ops aligning with global growth.

## Fit Assessment
Candidate's 15 years ops, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, aligns with Bear's global expansion (20+ countries, partnerships). Hardware (vehicles/electrical) translates to robot manufacturing/deployment. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) fits multi-robot AI fleets. Sectors (food service, logistics, last-mile) directly overlap hospitality/warehouse focus. BUILD desire matches post-LG scaling, new markets/products.

Gaps: No direct robotics, but hardware/AI bridges; limited acquisition experience in hardware, but relevant.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize AI/hardware scaling for multi-robot efficiency (e.g., "Scaled AI ops reducing headcount 99%—ready to optimize Servi/Carti fleets for 30-robot deployments"). Reference Ha/Higueros podcasts on innovation/future (e.g., Restaurant Rockstars on automation impact) to tie acquisitions to mission: "Eager to build global ops accelerating hospitality/logistics post-LG, empowering humans via efficiency." Highlight collaborative values; outreach via LinkedIn to Ha/Higueros, citing FASSTO production or Carti launch.
