# Hadrian Research

## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Hadrian builds AI-powered, autonomous factories that produce high-precision machined metal parts for aerospace, space, defense, and maritime programs. The company uses robotics, machine learning, process engineering, and proprietary software to manufacture parts 5–10x faster and more efficiently than traditional machine shops, with significantly lower costs. They offer a "Factories-as-a-Service" model — operating their own factories or deploying their automation technology inside customer facilities. In January 2026, they launched Hadrian Additive (production-ready additive manufacturing for defense).

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  Private, post-Series C. Valuation: $1.6 billion (late 2025/early 2026). Revenue not publicly disclosed, but grew aggressively (estimated multi-fold in 2024–2025). Early commercial stage with multiple operational factories and major defense contracts.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  $260 million Series C, closed July 2025, led by Founders Fund and Lux Capital. Additional undisclosed capital raise in late 2025/early 2026 led by T. Rowe Price, bringing valuation to $1.6B. Total funding to date ~$476–500 million.

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  ~346 employees (PitchBook, early 2026). Rapid growth: Expanding workforce significantly with new factories (350 new jobs from Mesa factory alone).

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Main operations in Torrance, California. New 290,000 sq ft Factory 3 in Mesa, Arizona (opened January 29, 2026). Planning large corporate/R&D headquarters. Roles are primarily on-site due to manufacturing focus; limited remote flexibility.

- **Key customers or partners.**  
  Major aerospace & defense primes (Lockheed Martin, Anduril, RTX, Boeing, space companies). Partnerships with Doosan Enerbility (machining capacity), Morgan Stanley (factory financing), and defense primes for on-site automation.

  January 22, 2026: Launched Hadrian Additive division for scalable defense additive manufacturing (production capacity online in 2026).  
  July 2025: Closed $260M Series C + announced Mesa factory.

- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  Strong positive coverage on Mesa factory opening, additive manufacturing launch, and reindustrialization mission (Phoenix Business Journal, PR Newswire, Breaking Defense, TechCrunch).

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  None major identified. Challenges: Rapid scaling of precision manufacturing capacity, attracting skilled manufacturing talent, and executing on aggressive factory buildout timelines.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  Factory 3 (Mesa, AZ) now operational (Jan 2026). Expanding Torrance headquarters/R&D to ~400,000 sq ft. Planning additional U.S. factories. Headcount growth: 350+ new jobs from Mesa alone; targeting thousands overall. New focus on additive manufacturing, maritime/shipbuilding, and munitions.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling precision manufacturing capacity rapidly, supply chain for high-end CNC machines and materials, attracting/retaining skilled machinists and engineers, maintaining extremely high quality standards for aerospace/defense parts, and executing on aggressive factory build timelines.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling factory operations and throughput, optimizing supply chain and vendor management, driving operational excellence across multiple sites, integrating new additive manufacturing processes, and managing rapid workforce growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Multiple large factories: Torrance, CA (2 facilities) + new 290,000 sq ft Factory 3 in Mesa, AZ. Total ~600,000 sq ft of advanced manufacturing space. High-precision CNC machining, robotics, and now additive manufacturing.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  Extremely high: Aerospace-grade precision machining (tight tolerances, exotic materials, ITAR compliance), long lead times for specialized equipment, complex vendor ecosystems, and rigorous quality/certification requirements.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Multiple operations/manufacturing roles (e.g., Manufacturing Engineers, Production Supervisors, Supply Chain Managers). No public Chief of Staff, VP Operations, or COO openings listed at this time. Strong hiring across engineering and factory operations.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  West Owens (CFO, Oct 2024), Matthew Parker (VP Additive Manufacturing, Jan 2026). Heavy hiring in manufacturing, engineering, and scaling roles.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Chris Power (founder-led company with strong hands-on leadership).

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Chris Power has been featured in TechCrunch, CNBC, Breaking Defense, and Not Boring (detailed profile). Reference his comments on reindustrializing America, competing with China, and building the "factory of the future."

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position yourself?**  
  Mission-driven: Reindustrialize America, restore U.S. manufacturing supremacy, counter China. Culture emphasizes speed, ambition, high performance, and using AI/robotics to empower American workers.

## Fit Assessment

**Excellent alignment (9.5/10).**  
Your background is a strong match:
- Hardware experience (custom vehicles + electrical engineers) → highly transferable to precision machining, robotics, and factory automation.
- AI transformation (150-person → 2-person AI-powered operation) → directly relevant to Hadrian's core AI + robotics model.
- Scaling operations across markets + acquisitions → ideal for their rapid factory buildout and expansion phase.
- Logistics/CPG background → relevant to complex supply chain and high-precision part delivery.

Your preference for **building operations** (vs. maintaining) is perfect — Hadrian is in hyper-growth mode with new factories and divisions.

**Strongest angle for outreach:**  
Position yourself as a proven **hardware + AI operations builder** who can help scale high-precision manufacturing factories at speed. Emphasize your track record in scaling complex operations, integrating hardware/electrical systems, and using AI to drive massive efficiency gains. Reference Chris Power's vision of reindustrializing America and competing globally — show you can execute on that mission at factory scale.
