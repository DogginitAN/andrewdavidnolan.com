## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Rising service/maintenance costs, limited vehicle/parts availability, technician/driver labor shortages, fuel price volatility, federal/state compliance, complexity in adopting new fuels/tech; post-acquisition integration (Auto Integrate), scaling workflows for outsourced/in-house repairs, managing diverse asset types/multi-site operations.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Integrating acquisitions (e.g., Auto Integrate for unified platform), scaling outsourced maintenance ecosystem (110k shops), optimizing workflows/automation for diverse fleets, addressing labor/cost challenges, managing multi-site/global operations.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  None directly (SaaS software company); manage digital platform for fleet ops, but customers handle physical fleets.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  Low for Fleetio (software); but platform addresses customer complexities in fleet supply chain (parts sourcing, vendor management via 110k shops, integrations for telematics/fuel).

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes: Strategy & Operations Manager (Marketplace, US); Head of Strategic Finance (GTM, US); Director Event Marketing (US). Operations-adjacent: Deployment Engineer, Facilities Technician, Supply Chain Analyst (from search). No explicit Chief of Staff or COO/VP Ops.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Jon Meachin or COO Matt Mandel.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Jon Meachin: 2024 NAFA recap (May 2024 webinar/blog on fleet trends). Trey Hoffman (former VP Customer Experience): Be Customer Led podcast (Jan 2023 on CX team building). No recent CEO podcasts found; reference earnings/growth releases.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Ownership (accountability), innovation (evolving tech), customer focus (seamless experience), team collaboration (one-stop-shop), excellence (measurable results). Culture: High-velocity execution, intensity/pragmatism, feedback-driven; entrepreneurial, transformative; rewarding ingenuity; flexible work/life. Position as builder in fast-growth SaaS, aligning with scaling ethos.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (9/10). Your 15 years in operations, scaling to 18 markets/$25M P&L, directly supports Fleetio's post-Series D growth (1M+ vehicles, 100+ countries) and acquisition integration (Auto Integrate). Hardware experience transfers to fleet tech integrations (telematics, OEMs). AI transformation resonates with automation/features like predictive maintenance. Sectors (food, logistics, CPG, last-mile) match customers/partners (e.g., PS Logistics, Razor Tracking). Build-not-maintain preference fits scaling phase (acquisitions, partnerships, product launches).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of scalable ops in logistics/hardware/AI, driving post-acquisition integration and workflow efficiency amid growth. Resonate: Reference Meachin's NAFA recap on trends; tie to values of ownership/innovation, positioning as accelerator for unified platform (e.g., outsourced repairs, shop network), aligning with customer-centric ethos. Outreach Meachin/Mandel via LinkedIn, citing H2 2025 results and 1M vehicle milestone.
