## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Satellite manufacturing/launch delays (e.g., production pushed to 2026); supply chain bottlenecks (components for phased arrays, ASICs); high cash burn (~$1.45B annualized); execution risks on backlog ($20B); scaling to 6+ satellites/month; regulatory approvals for spectrum/market access; competition from Starlink; cost per satellite ($21-23M) pressures; talent shortages in aerospace.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling manufacturing (vertical integration 95%, ramp to 45-60 satellites); optimizing supply chain resiliency; managing rapid deployments (e.g., BlueBird launches); executing backlog/NPI; reducing costs per satellite; leading talent acquisition for ops/engineering amid growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manufacturing: ~500,000 sq ft facilities (5 in TX, 1 in FL); AIT sites in MD, Spain, UK, Israel, India. Logistics: Global supply chain for satellite components; orbital launches (e.g., SpaceX, Blue Origin); gateway deployments.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: 95% vertical integration for Block 2 BB satellites; global vendors for ~5% specialized components (phased arrays, power systems, ASICs) with bottleneck risks; geopolitical vulnerabilities (reshoring focus); mass manufacturing transition; launches via partners (SpaceX, Blue Origin); distribution of services via MNO integrations.

## Open Roles

  Technical Project Manager (Full Remote); Quality Engineer - CIC (Midland, TX); Maintenance Manager (Midland, TX); Director, IT & Infrastructure (Midland, TX); GTM Reporting Manager (Midland, TX); Sr. Business Development Manager, USG (Remote); Mission Operations Development Engineer (Remote). No explicit COO/VP Ops/Chief of Staff, but operations-focused (e.g., Manufacturing Engineer, Event Marketing Specialist, Production Supervisor).

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Mike Williams (Director, System Integration/Test/Operations for Federal Programs, ~2025); Sean Crowley (Lead Mechanism System Architect); Dora Venna (Senior Integration & Automation Engineer). Signals building ops for federal/defense programs and manufacturing scale.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Abel Avellan (founder-led); COO Shanti Gupta.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  Abel Avellan: YouTube short on his history (Jan 2026); MWC Barcelona Keynote "Transforming Tomorrow's Connected World" (with Rakuten CEO, ~Feb 2026). Podcasts: AST SpaceMobile Podcast episodes (e.g., Feb 1, 2026 with Kook on superiority; Jan 2026 on talent hires like Mike Williams). Reference Avellan's vision for "total orbital supremacy."

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Innovation, connecting unconnected, democratizing digital access, performance-driven, forward-thinking, diversity of thought/experience. Culture: Fast-growing startup energy; proactive innovators wearing many hats; collaborative teams solving global challenges; eager to tackle hard problems for real impact.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile aligns moderately with AST SpaceMobile's early-commercial stage, focusing on satellite manufacturing/launch scaling amid high execution risks. With a COO in place, a VP Ops role could build under them for supply chain/manufacturing optimization. Your hardware design with engineers fits satellite AIT; AI transformation could apply to ops efficiency; multi-market scaling matches global expansion (50+ MNOs); logistics/CPG experience overlaps supply chain resiliency. However, space/aerospace domain gap; they seek defense/federal ops talent recently.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Emphasize BUILDING scalable hardware ops in high-risk, innovative environments—e.g., "I've scaled delivery to 18 markets with AI streamlining, akin to AST's satellite ramp to 45-60 by 2026 amid supply bottlenecks." Highlight defense/resiliency: "Your Golden Dome/SHIELD mission resonates with my transformations for secure, efficient ops." Reference Avellan's interviews (e.g., MWC Keynote on connected world) or podcasts on superiority. Outreach to Avellan/Gupta via LinkedIn, positioning as partner for manufacturing execution. Resonates with startup energy, innovation values, and challenge-tackling culture.
