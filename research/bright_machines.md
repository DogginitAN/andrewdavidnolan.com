## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Supply chain vulnerabilities (over-reliance on Asia, geopolitical risks); labor shortages in skilled manufacturing; outdated infrastructure limiting flexibility; scaling assembly for AI demand amid bottlenecks; high scrap rates in manual processes; balancing automation with agility.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In optimizing supply chain resiliency and distributed factories; scaling U.S.-based assembly operations; managing NPI and production ramps for AI infrastructure; reducing waste/scrap through automation; leading cross-functional teams for efficiency and innovation.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  AI Factories: Modular, robotic assembly lines for data centers (servers, racks); facilities in the U.S. (e.g., Florence, KY for operations). Logistics: Reshoring-focused supply chain for electronics components.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Fragmented global vendors for electronics; reshoring to avoid Asia dependencies; manual assembly (97%) leading to inefficiencies; GPU integrations with zero-scrap goals; geopolitical/security risks; distributed multi-location networks for resiliency.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Chief of Staff (San Francisco, CA; $180K-$240K; strategic partner to CEO). Operations Supervisor (Florence, KY). Assembly Operator (on-site). Manufacturing Engineering Director (Electronics; oversees NPI, production). No explicit COO/VP Ops, but operations-focused roles signal build-out.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**

  Values: Innovation in AI/automation, transformation of legacy manufacturing, efficiency, resiliency. Culture: Collaborative, full-stack approach; global team focused on solving real-world challenges; emphasis on diversity, curiosity, and professional growth (e.g., engineering spotlights). Position as a builder of scalable, resilient ops aligning with reshoring and AI focus.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery ops to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience designing custom vehicles with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI-powered setup, sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile delivery, desire to BUILD ops) aligns strongly with Bright Machines' Series C growth phase, focusing on reshoring AI infrastructure manufacturing. No dedicated COO/VP Ops creates opportunity to build the function amid scaling demands. Your hardware/AI expertise matches their robotic assembly and software-defined ops, while multi-market scaling fits their distributed factory model. Sectors overlap in logistics/supply chain resiliency.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Emphasize building resilient, scalable ops in hardware/AI environments—e.g., "I've scaled delivery across 18 markets with AI optimizations, akin to Bright Machines' automation for AI infrastructure reshoring." Highlight transformation: "Your mission to eliminate manual labor echoes my AI org rebuilds." Reference CEO Stori's focus on scaling (September 2024 announcement) or Susan's podcasts on manufacturing future. Outreach to Stori via LinkedIn, positioning as a partner for U.S. expansion. Resonates with innovation/resiliency values and labor/supply chain challenges.
