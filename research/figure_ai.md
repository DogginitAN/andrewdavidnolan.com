  Facilities: BotQ high-volume manufacturing (operational, scaling to 100,000 robots/3M actuators in 4 years). Markets: Home deployments (alpha testing 2025); Expand industrial (BMW/UPS) to logistics/warehousing. Headcount: Active hiring (platform software, manufacturing, integration); growth to support production.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  At Series C with commercial deployments, challenges include building/scaling new supply chain for humanoid-specific components (actuators, sensors; no mature ecosystem); High manufacturing costs/complexity for mass production (redesigned Figure 03 for volume); AI training compute demands; Dexterity/adaptability in unstructured environments; Integration with existing workflows/safety regulations; Energy constraints (battery life/uptime).

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Scaling BotQ manufacturing/supply chain (securing/scaling partners for 100,000 robots); Optimizing logistics for deployments (industrial/home); Managing AI infra/data collection for Helix; Ensuring operational efficiency/safety in high-stakes environments amid rapid growth.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  BotQ high-volume manufacturing facility (for humanoid assembly); Supply chain logistics for components (new tiered manufacturers); Deployment sites (e.g., BMW factory).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Built entirely new supply chain (no existing for humanoids); Partners scaled for 3M actuators/100,000 robots; Manufacturing reinvented for Figure 03 (cheaper, lighter); Distribution involves secure robot transport/deployments to customers.

## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience (custom vehicles with engineers), AI transformation (150-to-2 person org), sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile, and desire to build ops—alignment with Figure AI is very strong (9/10). Figure is in hyper-growth, scaling BotQ manufacturing amid new supply chains, mirroring your hardware/logistics scaling and AI efficiencies.

Key alignments:  
- **Building/scaling ops**: Figure's BotQ ramp to 100,000 robots suits your acquisitions/market expansions.  
- **Hardware/supply chain**: Custom design/logistics fits humanoid assembly and component sourcing.  
- **AI efficiency**: Org reduction applicable to Helix training/data ops.  
- **Sectors**: Logistics/CPG overlaps with warehouse/retail deployments (e.g., UPS).  

Gaps: Limited robotics/nuclear-level regs, but transferable. Ideal for build phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as ops builder for hardware/AI scale-ups in logistics/manufacturing, with proven efficiencies (AI org shift) and supply chain scaling. Reference Adcock's WTF Online (November 2025) on humanoids redefining economy or A360 (March 2025) on "iPhone moment." Resonate: "As Figure scales BotQ to 100,000 robots and deploys with BMW/UPS, my hardware/logistics scaling can build resilient ops to accelerate human-level AI impact."
