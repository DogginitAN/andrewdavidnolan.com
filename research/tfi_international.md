- 650+ facilities/terminals, large fleet, cross-border networks (US-Canada-Mexico)
- Multi-modal (LTL, TL, logistics), cross-border regulations, decentralized subsidiary operations

## Open Roles

- No public openings for COO, VP Ops, Chief of Staff, or C-suite

- Terminal/dock management and fleet roles signal ongoing ops needs

## Fit Assessment

Strong alignment (9/10). 15 years in operations including 3 acquisitions and scaling delivery to 18 markets/$25M P&L matches TFI's M&A-driven growth model. Logistics/last-mile/CPG experience directly relevant. Hardware/custom vehicle design transfers to fleet optimization; AI transformation aligns with tech-driven gains potential.

**Strongest angle:** Proven acquirer/integrator who scales logistics ops post-M&A while driving cost discipline and efficiency. Reference Bédard's comments on market cycles/2026 recovery; position as partner in executing tuck-in strategy and LTL/TL optimizations.
