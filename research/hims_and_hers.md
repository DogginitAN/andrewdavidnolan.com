  Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (HIMS) operates a multi-specialty telehealth platform that connects consumers to licensed healthcare providers for personalized treatments in areas such as weight loss (including GLP-1 medications), sexual health, hair loss, dermatology, mental health, and skincare.

Revenue comes primarily from subscriptions (high retention), product sales, and personalized offerings.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling compounding pharmacy operations amid regulatory volatility (FDA on GLP-1 compounding), managing supply chain concentration/vulnerabilities for active ingredients, ensuring discreet/fast DTC logistics nationwide, vertical integration for manufacturing, and handling rapid subscriber growth while maintaining compliance/safety.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Optimizing supply chain and fulfillment for personalized/compounded products, scaling logistics/DTC shipping, integrating AI for operational efficiency/personalization, managing new facilities/expansion, and navigating regulatory complexities in pharmacy operations.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Affiliated compounding facilities (e.g., Largo, FL), fulfillment centers, and new planned site in Columbus region. Logistics involve nationwide shipping of temperature-sensitive/discreet packages via partners.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Reliance on third-party suppliers for GLP-1 ingredients (shortage risks), in-house/affiliated compounding pharmacies (FDA-regulated), vertical integration efforts for control, and DTC distribution requiring fast, compliant, discreet delivery across millions of subscribers.

  Yes, 104+ open positions including Sr. Manager Compounding Operations, fulfillment roles, care operations, and hardware/design engineering (ops-adjacent). No explicit Chief of Staff or VP/COO listed, but multiple senior ops/fulfillment manager roles signal building.

  Likely CEO Andrew Dudum (hands-on founder) or new COO Mike Chi, given recent transition and focus on operational scaling.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - Andrew Dudum: Hims House podcast (March 27, 2025) discussing growth and personalization; older appearances on Fitt Insider (2020), Founder Hour (2021), Wharton (2022). Themes: Disrupting healthcare access, consumer empowerment, AI/personalization in 2026 outlook.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Accessibility (health not a luxury), Innovation (personalized care), Transparency, Equity (addressing health-wealth gap). Culture: Mission-driven, fast-paced, consumer-focused; emphasis on destigmatizing care and bold marketing (e.g., Super Bowl ads). Position as a builder enabling scale/access for impact.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling delivery to 18 markets/$25M P&L, hardware design with engineers, AI transformation reducing 150-person org to 2-person, sectors in food/logistics/CPG/last-mile, focus on BUILDING ops) aligns well with Hims & Hers' needs. The company is in aggressive scaling mode (rapid revenue/subscriber growth, new facilities, compounding expansion), requiring expertise in DTC logistics, supply chain optimization, and AI efficiency—directly leveraging your last-mile/delivery scaling and AI background. Hardware experience less central, but regulated product fulfillment mirrors CPG/logistics complexity. Unlike mature firms, HIMS offers ops building amid regulatory/pharma challenges.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Lead with scaling DTC delivery/logistics in consumer-facing sectors (e.g., "Scaled operations to 18 markets with $25M P&L in last-mile delivery, ready to optimize Hims' nationwide fulfillment and compounding scale"). Tie to AI: "Transformed 150-person ops to AI-powered efficiency, aligning with Hims' personalization vision." Emphasize building for access/impact: "Built/sold 3 companies; eager to drive operational excellence for equitable healthcare." Reference Dudum's podcast on growth/personalization and recent Super Bowl equity focus to show alignment. Resonate by positioning as a partner in disrupting luxury healthcare.
