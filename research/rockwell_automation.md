- **Press coverage highlights.**  
  - Positive: Q1 2026 earnings beat (EPS $2.75 vs. $2.46 est.); raised FY2026 guidance (organic sales 2-6%, Adjusted EPS $11.40-$12.20). Recognition in 20 Gartner 2025 Hype Cycles (manufacturing, AI, cybersecurity). Sustainability report emphasizes resilient operations. Automation Fair 2025 showcased 30+ new products. CNBC interview with CEO Moret on prudent outlook.  
  - Industry: WSJ on profit jump; Bloomberg on dodging AI selloff via industrial software.

- **Any controversies or challenges.**  
  - Challenges: Project delays due to customer CapEx cuts, demand/funding issues (not cancellations). EMEA/Asia Pacific sales declines in FY2025 (1-5%). Supply chain frictions (e.g., incentive timing reduced Q1 cash flow). Broader: Inflation, competition from private labels in CPG sectors. No major controversies; focus on operational headwinds like sluggish CapEx recovery.

- **Expansion plans (new markets, facilities, headcount).**  
  - New facilities: 1M sq ft greenfield in New Berlin, WI (advanced automation, robotics; part of $2B U.S. expansion). Investments in modernizing plants/digital infra.  
  - Markets: Emphasis on U.S. manufacturing resilience; growth in AI/smart manufacturing (e.g., Microsoft lab). No new headcount targets, but talent investments for FY2026.

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Global supply chain disruptions (e.g., port congestion, material shortages), inventory overstock from prior years, high expediting costs due to visibility gaps, quality assurance in complex manufacturing, slow response to demand/supply fluctuations. Macro: Customer CapEx delays (cost/demand issues), regional sales softness (EMEA down 1%, Asia Pacific down 5% in FY2025). Cybersecurity risks in OT environments; talent shortages in skilled engineering.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In building scalable, AI-driven operations (e.g., transforming manual processes to autonomous systems), optimizing global supply chains for resilience, leading digital transformation (IT/OT convergence), and executing $2B expansion (new facilities, inventory management). Value in reducing costs (e.g., via MES for efficiency), enhancing agility in volatile markets, and integrating AI to replace labor-intensive ops (aligns with candidate's experience).

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Owns global manufacturing facilities (e.g., Milwaukee HQ with production/warehouse), distribution centers, and warehouses. New WI site: 1M+ sq ft with advanced automation/robotics. Manages end-to-end logistics for hardware/software delivery to 100+ countries.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Global supply chain with dependencies on key suppliers/commodities; multi-segment operations (devices, software, services). Challenges include inventory control, expediting, and adapting to disruptions. Uses digital tools (e.g., Plex SCP) for visibility/planning; focuses on flexible production to mitigate risks.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Open senior ops roles: EDGE Leadership Development Program (Integrated Supply Chain Track) – rotational program for early-career in planning, quality, manufacturing engineering, operations (US-based, e.g., Twinsburg, OH). Commercial Operations Manager, Asia Pacific (Software Portfolio) – leadership in ops/sales. No explicit COO/VP Ops or Chief of Staff openings listed; focus on mid-level ops (e.g., D2R Program Operations Lead for governance/delivery). General careers emphasize supply chain, manufacturing, and leadership tracks.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Leadership transitions July 2025 (post-Nicolas departure); new SVP roles in supply chain/software. Building via programs like EDGE (supply chain rotations) and investments in talent ($2B plan). Signals: Focus on ops resilience through hires in cybersecurity (Senior OT Cybersecurity Architect, Asia Pacific) and software ops.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  CEO Blake Moret (oversees strategic hires) or SVP Chief Supply Chain Officer Bob Buttermore (ops oversight). Rebecca House (Chief People Officer) may handle recruitment.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - CNBC "Mad Money" (Nov 18, 2025): Moret on Automation Fair, industrial demand, growth areas.  
  - CIO Leadership Live podcast (Feb 4, 2026): CDIO Chris Nardecchia on IT/digital transformation, AI in manufacturing, cybersecurity.  
  - Automation Fair 2025 keynote (Nov 2025): Moret on "automation to autonomy," AI simplification.  
  - Marketplace NPR (Dec 2025): Moret on tariffs/factory activity.  
  - OT After Hours podcast (post-Automation Fair 2025): Ken Kully on event insights.

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Integrity (win the right way), excellence, teamwork, customer focus, inclusion/diversity. Culture: Collaborative, innovative, ethical; emphasizes trust, belonging, and employee growth (mentorship, development programs). Position as builder of resilient ops aligning with digital transformation/sustainability; highlight AI/hardware exp to resonate with "expanding human possibility" ethos.

## Fit Assessment

The candidate's profile aligns strongly with Rockwell Automation's needs in digital transformation, operational scaling, and building resilient systems. With 15 years in operations, including 3 acquisitions (built/sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware design (custom vehicles with engineers), and AI transformation (reducing 150-person org to 2 via AI), the candidate matches Rockwell's focus on AI-enhanced manufacturing, supply chain optimization, and global expansion. Sectors (food service, logistics, CPG, last-mile) overlap with Rockwell's CPG/energy/logistics customers, where competition and innovation are priorities (per 2025 Smart Manufacturing Report).

Challenges like supply chain disruptions and CapEx delays at Rockwell would benefit from the candidate's building expertise (vs. maintaining), especially in AI-driven efficiency. The desire to "BUILD operations" fits Rockwell's $2B expansion (new facilities, digital infra) and shift to autonomous ops.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Lead with AI transformation success—replacing large teams with efficient AI ops resonates with Moret's "automation to autonomy" vision and cost-cutting amid delays. Reference hardware/logistics exp to tie into supply chain resilience (e.g., new WI facility). Position as a builder for growth: "I've scaled ops in volatile sectors like yours; let's build Rockwell's next-gen resilient operations." Reference Moret's CNBC interview on prudent outlook to show alignment with macro challenges. Emphasize integrity/teamwork in pitch to match culture. Outreach to Moret/Buttermore via LinkedIn, citing shared NAM involvement or Automation Fair insights.
