## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience (custom vehicles with engineers), AI transformation (150-to-2 person org), sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile, and desire to build ops—alignment with Physical Intelligence is strong (8/10). PI is early-stage, compute/hardware-heavy, focused on scaling AI for physical tasks, mirroring your building expertise in AI/hardware ops.

Key alignments:  
- **Building ops**: PI needs to scale from R&D lab to deployments; your acquisitions/market growth fits facility/compute expansions.  
- **Hardware/supply chain**: Custom design/logistics aligns with robot arm integration and data pipelines.  
- **AI efficiency**: Org transformation applicable to optimizing compute-heavy models.  
- **Sectors**: Logistics/CPG insights suit PI's tasks (e.g., bagging, assembly).  

Gaps: No direct robotics; high research focus. Overall, ideal for building phase.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as ops builder for AI/hardware scale-ups, with proven efficiencies (AI org reduction) and hardware scaling amid complexity. Reference Hausman's Unsupervised Learning podcast on generalist robots or Levine's Dwarkesh on autonomy timelines, emphasizing acceleration of lab-to-real-world ops. Resonate: "As PI deploys π*0.6 across embodiments, my hardware/AI scaling can build resilient ops to leverage $1B+ funding for physical AI impact."
