## Fit Assessment

Given your profile—15 years in operations, leading 3 acquisitions (built and sold), scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience (custom vehicles with electrical engineers), AI transformation (reducing 150-person org to 2-person AI-powered), sectors in food service, logistics, CPG, and last-mile delivery, and desire to BUILD operations—alignment with Equinix is moderate (6/10). Equinix is a mature public REIT with established global operations, but its AI-driven expansions and power challenges offer opportunities to build resilient infrastructure.

Key alignments:  
- **Scaling and multi-market operations**: Your experience expanding to 18 markets aligns with Equinix's global data center growth across 74 metros.  
- **Hardware and supply chain**: Custom hardware design and logistics expertise fit managing data center equipment procurement and expansions amid shortages.  
- **AI transformation and efficiency**: Reducing org size with AI mirrors Equinix's need to optimize operations for AI workloads and energy efficiency.  
- **Sectors overlap**: Logistics and CPG insights could inform interconnection services for enterprise customers.

Potential gaps: Limited direct data center or REIT experience; Equinix's ops involve high regulatory compliance and sustainability focus, which may lean more toward maintenance in core business.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Position as a proven ops builder in hardware-logistics environments with AI-driven efficiencies, ready to scale AI-ready infrastructure amid power constraints. Reference Fox-Martin's Times Tech Podcast (October 2025) on AI demands, highlighting how your multi-market scaling and AI transformations can accelerate Equinix's "build bolder" strategy. Resonate with leadership: Emphasize contributing to sustainability and global growth, e.g., "As Equinix expands AI data centers to meet $9B+ revenue trajectory, my expertise in building resilient supply chains and AI-optimized ops can mitigate power risks and drive efficiency."
