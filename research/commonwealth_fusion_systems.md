# Commonwealth Fusion Systems Research

## Company Profile

- **What does the company do? Core business model.**  
  Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is a fusion energy company focused on developing and commercializing compact tokamak fusion power plants using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets. The core business model involves designing, manufacturing, and scaling fusion systems to produce clean, limitless, baseload energy. CFS is building SPARC, the world's first net-energy-producing fusion machine, as a prototype to pave the way for ARC, its commercial fusion power plant. Revenue will come from power purchase agreements (PPAs) and partnerships, with an emphasis on in-house integration of R&D, manufacturing, and operations to accelerate commercialization.

- **Current stage (Series ?, public, revenue if known).**  
  CFS is a private, late-stage startup at Series B (specifically Series B2 as of August 2025). It is not public and has no reported revenue yet, as it is pre-commercialization and focused on R&D and prototype development.

- **Recent funding (amount, date, lead investors).**  
  CFS raised $863 million in a Series B2 round on August 28, 2025, led by investors including Tiger Global Management, Lowercase Capital, Khosla Ventures, Breakthrough Energy Ventures (Bill Gates), Eni, Google, NVentures (NVIDIA's VC arm), Hillspire, and Emerson Collective. This brings total funding to approximately $3 billion since founding in 2018.

- **Employee count and growth trajectory.**  
  CFS has over 1,000 employees as of 2025, with approximately 1,100 reported in December 2025. Growth has been rapid: from 151 employees in 2021, to 500 in May 2023, to 1,000+ in 2025. The company is actively hiring, with plans for further expansion tied to SPARC operations and ARC development.

- **Headquarters and remote policy.**  
  Headquarters are in Devens, Massachusetts (117 Hospital Road), with a 165,000 square foot manufacturing facility and campus opened in January 2023. Remote policy is not explicitly stated, but most roles (e.g., operations, manufacturing) are on-site or hybrid, with a focus on in-person collaboration for hardware-intensive work.

- **Key customers or partners.**  
  Key customers include Google (200 MW PPA from first ARC plant, announced June 30, 2025) and Eni (over $1 billion PPA, announced September 22, 2025). Partners include MIT (HTS magnet collaboration), Google DeepMind (AI alliance, announced January 2026), NVIDIA and Siemens (digital twin development, announced January 6, 2026), Type One Energy (fusion magnet supply agreement, announced February 11, 2025), UKAEA (collaboration announced July 2024), and Dominion Energy (ARC site partnership in Virginia).

## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  At late-stage prototype development, challenges include scaling HTS magnet manufacturing, ensuring supply chain reliability for specialized components (e.g., no mature ecosystem, so much is in-house), integrating AI/digital twins for simulation, regulatory permitting for fusion facilities, achieving net energy (Q>1) in SPARC by 2026-2027, and transitioning from R&D to industrial operations while managing rapid headcount growth.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  A senior ops leader would add value in building scalable manufacturing processes for magnets and tokamaks, optimizing supply chain and logistics for global expansion, integrating AI for operational efficiency (e.g., digital twins), managing P&L for emerging revenue streams like PPAs, and overseeing the transition from prototype (SPARC) to commercial plant operations (ARC), ensuring execution speed and cost control.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  CFS manages a 47-acre campus in Devens, MA, including a 165,000 sq ft manufacturing facility for HTS magnets and SPARC assembly. Logistics include global supplier networks for fusion ecosystem components, with plans for ARC site in Virginia (permitting and construction starting soon).

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: In-house manufacturing of HTS magnets due to novelty; global partnerships for R&D (e.g., MIT, UKAEA); supply chain for rare materials and precision engineering is immature, requiring vertical integration. Distribution will involve energy delivery via grid connections (e.g., Dominion for ARC), with challenges in scaling to thousands of plants worldwide.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Yes, several senior operations and leadership roles are open:  
  - Director, SPARC Plant Operations ($250,000-$350,000 salary).  
  - General Manager, SPARC Plant ($275,000-$350,000 + equity).  
  - Vice President of Production (helm manufacturing processes).  
  - Manager, Cybersecurity & Operations ($110,000-$185,000).  
  - Operations Engineer - SPARC.  
  - Senior Director of Facilities, Maintenance, and Construction.  
  - Principal Technical Project Manager.  
  No specific Chief of Staff role listed, but 54+ total openings, including other ops-related positions like Assembly Process Engineer and Lead Production Welder.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Julian Soell as COO (recent, signals focus on scaling ops). Active hiring in ops (e.g., 35+ roles including senior ones) indicates building out the operations function for SPARC/ARC commercialization.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Likely CEO Bob Mumgaard or COO Julian Soell, given the small C-suite and Mumgaard's hands-on role in strategic hires. For senior ops, it could involve the board or HR leads, but CEO/COO would approve.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  - Bob Mumgaard: "Nuclear Fusion and the New Energy Arms Race" (Apple Podcasts, January 2, 2026); "A Conversation with Bob Mumgaard" (YouTube, March 24, 2025); "Watt It Takes" podcast (Spotify, October 31, 2023, but relevant); "Inside the Race for Fusion Energy" (CNBC, October 1, 2025); "Creating Stars in a Bottle" (YouTube with Vinod Khosla); "The Fusion Fix" (YouTube, New York Times event); MCJ Podcast (May 30, 2025). Reference themes like fusion's role in AI power and commercialization urgency.  
  - Other: CFS 6-month update video (YouTube, January 2026).

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Integrity (scientific honesty, treating people well), Execution (speed, no stagnation), Impact (economic viability for climate change), Self-critique (data-driven, open dialogue). Culture is mission-driven, collaborative, with a focus on accountability, transparency, and rethinking processes (e.g., building like hospitals, not traditional construction). Position as a builder aligned with urgent innovation and failure-tolerant progress.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years in operations, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaling delivery to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience designing custom vehicles with electrical engineers, AI transformation reducing a 150-person org to 2-person AI-powered ops, sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile delivery, and desire to BUILD operations) aligns strongly with CFS's needs. CFS is in a build-from-scratch phase, transitioning from R&D to industrial-scale fusion plants, requiring expertise in scaling hardware ops, supply chains, and AI efficiency—mirroring your hardware/AI background. Your acquisition/scaling experience fits their rapid growth (1,000+ employees) and global expansion plans (e.g., Virginia plant, international dialogues). Unlike mature companies, CFS offers opportunities to build ops functions, not maintain them, with challenges in manufacturing/logistics that leverage your last-mile/sector diversity.

**Strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
  Emphasize your track record in building innovative ops from the ground up, especially hardware scaling with AI optimization (e.g., "I transformed a 150-person operation into a 2-person AI-driven system, similar to how CFS uses AI/digital twins for fusion efficiency"). Highlight alignment with values like Execution and Impact: "I've scaled ops across 18 markets while managing $25M P&L, ready to build CFS's supply chain and manufacturing for urgent climate impact." Reference Mumgaard's interviews on fusion's "big transition" and need for integrated ops (e.g., CNBC on AI power, podcasts on commercialization speed) to show research. Position as a partner in creating the fusion industry, not just joining—resonating with their mission-driven, self-critical culture.
