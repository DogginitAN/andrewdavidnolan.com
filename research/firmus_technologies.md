## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Scaling immersion cooling across diverse climates while maintaining 50%+ energy savings; securing renewable power amid grid strain (e.g., integrating wind/solar/hydro); supply chain dependencies for Nvidia chips and components (mitigated by local manufacturing); talent acquisition for specialized AI/hardware roles; regulatory approvals for large-scale facilities; balancing rapid growth with sustainability goals.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  In scaling multi-site deployments (e.g., Project Southgate coordination); optimizing supply chain and local manufacturing partnerships; managing renewable energy integration and grid orchestration; leading field operations for reliability and efficiency; driving cost reductions in high-density computing; overseeing talent growth for ops teams.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Manage AI data centers: Tasmania flagship (R&D since 2019); new sites in Melbourne/Tasmania (150MW each, online April 2026); expansions to Canberra/Sydney/Perth. Includes immersion cooling systems, modular compute blocks, and renewable power setups. Logistics: Transport/install hardware nationwide, with quick retrofits.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High complexity: Sourcing Nvidia GPUs and components globally; local manufacturing via Benmax (mechanical) and JLE (electrical) to reduce overseas reliance (committed A$300M); distribution of modular systems to sites; challenges in tolerances for cooling tech and electrification in remote areas like Tasmania.

## Open Roles

- **Any current openings for operations, Chief of Staff, or leadership roles?**  
  Senior Operations Manager (Melbourne; oversee data center ops and strategy). Other: Risk Manager (Sydney); Operations Excellence Engineer (Data Centre Ops, Singapore/Australia); VP Sales ANZ (recently filled but signals growth). No explicit Chief of Staff or COO roles.

- **Recent ops/leadership hires (signals they're building the function).**  
  Senior hires in ops/leadership (e.g., Senior Ops Manager posted Jan 2026; Ops Excellence Engineer); C-suite additions like CPO and VP Sales in Nov 2025 signal building ops and growth functions for scaling.

## Outreach Intel

- **Who would be the decision-maker for a VP Ops / COO hire? (likely CEO or COO if exists).**  
  Co-CEOs Oliver Curtis and Tim Rosenfield, as the company is founder-led with no COO; they oversee strategy and operations.

- **Any public interviews, podcasts, or talks by leadership I should reference?**  
  October 15, 2025: Oliver Curtis at AI Day Sydney (Nvidia On-Demand: "Building a Sovereign, Green AI Factory for the Southern Hemisphere"). Daniel Kearney (CTO) on YouTube (November 2025: Liquid Cooling, AI Factories & Data Centers). Tim Rosenfield quotes in funding announcements (e.g., Nov 2025: "Vertically integrated AI Factory platform").

- **Company values or culture signals that inform how to position myself?**  
  Values: Energy efficiency, sustainability (green AI revolution), innovation in vertical integration, sovereignty (Australian-made supply chain). Culture: Relentless focus on scalability and profitability; collaborative with global partners; human-centric growth (e.g., creating local jobs). Position as a builder of efficient, scalable ops aligning with their "max-q" ethos for AI optimization and renewable focus.

## Fit Assessment

Your profile (15 years operations experience, 3 acquisitions built/sold, scaled delivery ops to 18 markets with $25M P&L, hardware experience designing custom vehicles with engineers, AI transformation replacing 150-person org with 2-person AI-powered setup, sectors in food service/logistics/CPG/last-mile delivery, desire to BUILD ops) aligns strongly with Firmus's needs as a high-growth AI infrastructure firm lacking a dedicated ops leader. They're scaling multi-site data centers (similar to your market expansions), integrating hardware/AI (mirroring your vehicle design and AI org transformation), and focusing on efficient logistics/supply chains in renewables/hardware—overlapping your sectors. No COO means opportunity to build the function from scratch amid Project Southgate's national rollout.

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Emphasize your track record in BUILDING scalable ops in hardware/AI-heavy environments—e.g., "I've scaled logistics to 18 markets while leveraging AI to optimize orgs, akin to Firmus's immersion cooling and renewable integration for efficient AI factories." Highlight sustainability alignment: "Your green AI mission echoes my AI transformations that cut costs and enhanced efficiency." Position as a strategic partner to Co-CEOs Curtis/Rosenfield in national expansion, referencing Project Southgate and Nvidia partnership. Outreach via LinkedIn to Curtis or Rosenfield, citing recent Maas investment or Blackstone loan to demonstrate awareness. This resonates with their innovation/sovereignty focus and rapid scaling needs.
