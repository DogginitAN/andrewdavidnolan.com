## Fit Assessment

High alignment (9/10). Your 15 years in operations, including scaling to 18 markets and $25M P&L, directly matches GXO's global expansions and complex supply chain management. 3 acquisitions (build/sell) resonate with their M&A strategy (e.g., Wincanton). Hardware experience (custom vehicles/electrical) transfers to automation/robotics integrations. AI transformation (150-to-2 org) aligns with their AI-native OS (GXO IQ) and tech focus. Sectors like food service, logistics, CPG, last-mile delivery overlap with customers (Nestle, Nike, Inditex) and services (e-commerce fulfillment, managed transport). Build-not-maintain preference fits their growth phase (organizational changes, expansions).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Proven builder of scalable logistics ops with AI/hardware expertise, driving efficiency/post-acquisition integration amid growth. Resonate: Reference Wilson/Kelleher's talks on trends/execution (CNBC/earnings); tie to values of innovation/customer focus, positioning as partner for operational excellence and sustainability, aligning with "Logistics at full potential" ethos. Outreach Kelleher/Beeks via LinkedIn, citing recent expansions (BAE, Luton) and Q3 results.
