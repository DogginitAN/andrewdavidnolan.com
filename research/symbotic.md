## Operational Landscape

- **What are their likely operational challenges at this stage?**  
  Customer concentration (Walmart risk); supply chain bottlenecks (chips, components); scaling deployments/timelines; margin pressures (competition, costs); labor/talent for growth; integration post-acquisitions.

- **Where would a senior ops hire add the most value?**  
  Supply chain ops/supplier management; multi-site deployment scaling; efficiency in manufacturing/installations; cost control/margin improvement; post-retirement transition.

- **What physical/logistics infrastructure do they manage (if any)?**  
  Facilities/terminals across North America; customer warehouse installations (robots, structures); global supply chain for components.

- **Supply chain, manufacturing, or distribution complexity?**  
  High: Custom robotics/hardware; reliant on NVIDIA/others; global sourcing (e.g., Europe suppliers); deployment to customer sites; risks in velocity, costs.

## Fit Assessment

High alignment (9/10). Your 15 years scaling ops (18 markets, $25M P&L, acquisitions) matches Symbotic's deployment ramp and M&A (e.g., Fox Robotics). Hardware experience transfers to robotics/manufacturing. AI transformation aligns with software efficiency. Logistics/CPG/food sectors match customers (grocery/retail). Build focus fits growth (e.g., Europe/cold chain).

**What's the strongest angle for outreach? What would resonate with this company's leadership?**  
Strongest angle: Builder of AI/hardware ops in logistics, accelerating scaling amid demand. Resonate: Tie to Cohen's vision of reimagining supply chain; position as integrator for deployments/margins, aligning with innovation/excellence. Reference Q1 earnings/backlog.
